8. Includes


Objective

We're going to be iterating through many tweets and printing out their location. Refactor the controller code below to use the includes method.
   

models
class Tweet < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :location, dependent: :destroy
end
 
class Location < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :tweet
end


app/controllers/tweets_controller.rb
class TweetsController < ApplicationController 
  def index
    @tweets = Tweet.recent
  end
end


Answer:
app/controllers/tweets_controller.rb
class TweetsController < ApplicationController 
  def index
    @tweets = Tweet.recent.includes(:location).all
  end
end
