3. Mail Delivery


Objective

Finish coding the check_ammo method on the Weapon model so when we have exactly three ammo left, it will send out the low_ammo mailer we just created.


weapon_mailer.rb
class WeaponMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  default from: "admin@rfz.com"
        
  def low_ammo(weapon, zombie)
    mail to: zombie.email, subject: "#{weapon.name} has low ammo"
  end 
end


app/models/weapon.rb
class Weapon < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :zombie 
  before_save :check_ammo
  def check_ammo
  end
end
 	

Answer:
app/models/weapon.rb
class Weapon < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :zombie 

  before_save :check_ammo

  def check_ammo   
    WeaponMailer.low_ammo(self, self.zombie).deliver if ammo == 3
  end
end
