We'd like our game library to be able to execute blocks of code on its games. Finish implementing the exec_game method, which runs the action Proc on a game. Then in main.rb, call exec_game for Contra, passing in the print_details Proc.


seeds.rb
GAMES = [
  Game.new('Contra', year: 1987, system: 'NES'),
  Game.new('Civilization', year: 1991, system: 'PC'),
  Game.new('The Legend of Zelda', year: 1986, system: 'NES'),
  Game.new('Mega Man X2', year: 1995, system: 'SNES'),
  Game.new('Super Metroid', year: 1994, system: 'SNES'),
  Game.new('Sim City 2000', year: 1993, system: 'PC'),
  Game.new('Starcraft', year: 1998, system: 'PC')
]


game.rb
class Game 
  attr_accessor :name

  def initialize(name, options)
    @name = name
    @year = options[:year]
    @system = options[:system]
  end
end


main.rb
library = Library.new(GAMES)
print_details = Proc.new do |game|
  puts "#{game.name} (#{game.system}) - #{game.year}"
end


library.rb
class Library
  attr_accessor :games

  def initialize(games)
    @games = games
  end

  def exec_game(name, action)
    game = games.detect { |game| game.name = name }

  end
end


Answer:
main.rb
library = Library.new(GAMES)
print_details = Proc.new do |game|
  puts "#{game.name} (#{game.system}) - #{game.year}"
end
library.exec_game("Contra", print_details)


library.rb
class Library
  attr_accessor :games

  def initialize(games)
    @games = games
  end

  def exec_game(name, action)
    game = games.detect { |game| game.name = name }
    action.call(game)
  end
end
