5. Capturing Blocks


Refactor this each method to capture its block as a Proc object, then inside of the games.each block, call the captured Proc instead of yielding.


library.rb
class Library
  attr_accessor :games

  def initialize(games)
    @games = games
  end

  def each
    games.each do |game|
      yield game
    end
  end
end


Answer:
library.rb
class Library
  attr_accessor :games

  def initialize(games)
    @games = games
  end
  
  block = lambda{|game| game}
  
  def each(&block)
    games.each(&block)
  end  
end
