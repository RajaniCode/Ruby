3. delegating Part 1


Implement method_missing to delegate all unknown method calls to the Library's @manager object. Make sure to pass along any arguments as well.


library.rb
class Library
  def initialize(console)
    @manager = console
  end

  def method_missing(name, *args)

  end
end


Answer:
library.rb
class Library
  def initialize(console)
    @manager = console
  end

  def method_missing(name, *args)
    @manager.send(name, *args)
  end
end
