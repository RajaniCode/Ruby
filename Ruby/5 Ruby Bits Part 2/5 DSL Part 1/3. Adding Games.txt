3. Adding Games


Now we can get started implementing our DSL. The example below shows the syntax we'd like to use for the DSL. Let's ignore the block for now and make the add_game method work. Implement add_game, creating a new Game object with the given name and adding it to the library.


example.rb
add_game "Civilization" do
  system "PC"
  year 1991
end


game.rb
class Game
  attr_reader :name
 
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end


library.rb
class Library
  def initialize
    @games = []
  end
 
  def add_game(game)
    @games << game
  end
end


game_dsl.rb
LIBRARY = Library.new

def add_game(name)

end


Answer:
game_dsl.rb
LIBRARY = Library.new

def add_game(name)
  game = Game.new(name)
  LIBRARY.add_game(game)
end
