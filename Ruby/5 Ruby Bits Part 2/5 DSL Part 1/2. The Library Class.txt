2. The Library Class


We'll also need a class to represent our game library, holding an array of games. Implement its initialize method, initializing the @games instance variable to an empty array. Then implement add_game, which should take a game and add it to the array.


game.rb
class Game
  attr_reader :name
 
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end


file_name
class Library

end


Answer:
file_name
class Library
  def initialize
    @games = []
  end
  def add_game(game)
    @games << game    
  end
end
