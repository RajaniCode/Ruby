1. The Game Class


We're going to build a DSL to help manage our game library. Since we know we'll need a Game class, let's go ahead and create a simple one. Implement an initialize method that takes the game's name and stores it in an instance variable, then add an attr_reader for the name.


game.rb
class Game

end


Answer:
game.rb
class Game
  attr_reader :name
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end
