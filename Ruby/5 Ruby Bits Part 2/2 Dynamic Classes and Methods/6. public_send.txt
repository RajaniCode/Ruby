6. public_send


The game find method in library.rb should be protected, so make that change. Then, in main.rb, change all the send calls in main.rb to use the more secure public_send. We're expecting this to raise an exception.


seed.rb
GAMES = [
  Game.new('Contra', year: 1987, system: 'NES'),
  Game.new('Civilization', year: 1991, system: 'PC'),
  Game.new('The Legend of Zelda', year: 1986, system: 'NES'),
  Game.new('Mega Man X2', year: 1995, system: 'SNES'),
  Game.new('Super Metroid', year: 1994, system: 'SNES'),
  Game.new('Sim City 2000', year: 1993, system: 'PC'),
  Game.new('Starcraft', year: 1998, system: 'PC')
]


main.rb
library = Library.new(GAMES)
library.send(:list)
library.send(:emulate, "Contra")
game = library.send(:find, "Contra")


library.rb
class Library
  attr_accessor :games

  def initialize(games)
    self.games = games
  end

  def list
    puts games.join("\n")
  end

  def emulate(name)
    game = find(name)
    puts "Starting emulator for #{game}..."
  end

  def find(name)
    games.detect { |game| game.name == name }
  end
end


Answer:
library.rb
class Library
  attr_accessor :games

  def initialize(games)
    self.games = games
  end

  def list
    puts games.join("\n")
  end

  def emulate(name)
    game = find(name)
    puts "Starting emulator for #{game}..."
  end
  
  protected
  def find(name)
    games.detect { |game| game.name == name }
  end
end


main.rb
library = Library.new(GAMES)
library.public_send(:list)
library.public_send(:emulate, "Contra")
game = library.public_send(:find, "Contra")
