3. alias_method


Our game library has an each method that iterates the list of games. Add a method called each_game that does the same thing as each, but without duplicating the code.


library.rb
class Library
  attr_accessor :games

  def each(&block)
    games.each(&block)
  end
end


Answer:
library.rb
class Library
  attr_accessor :games

  def each(&block)
    games.each(&block)
  end
  
  alias_method :each_game, :each
end
