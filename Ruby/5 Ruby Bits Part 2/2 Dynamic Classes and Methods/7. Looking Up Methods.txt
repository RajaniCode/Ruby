7. Looking Up Methods


Refactor this code to look up Method objects for the 'list' and 'emulate' methods, then call them.


seed.rb
GAMES = [
  Game.new('Contra', year: 1987, system: 'NES'),
  Game.new('Civilization', year: 1991, system: 'PC'),
  Game.new('The Legend of Zelda', year: 1986, system: 'NES'),
  Game.new('Mega Man X2', year: 1995, system: 'SNES'),
  Game.new('Super Metroid', year: 1994, system: 'SNES'),
  Game.new('Sim City 2000', year: 1993, system: 'PC'),
  Game.new('Starcraft', year: 1998, system: 'PC')
]


library.rb
class Library
  attr_accessor :games
 
  def initialize(games)
    self.games = games
  end
 
  def list
    puts games.join("\n")
  end
 
  def emulate(name)
    game = find(name)
    puts "Starting emulator for #{game}..."
  end
 
  protected
 
  def find(name)
    games.detect { |game| game.name == name }
  end
end


main.rb
library = Library.new(GAMES)
library.list
library.emulate("Contra")


Answer:
main.rb
library = Library.new(GAMES)
#library.list
list = library.method(:list)
list.call
#library.emulate("Contra")
emulate = library.method(:emulate)
emulate.call("Contra")
