6. Numbers


Refactor the describe_count method below to use ActiveSupport in order to find out if a number is even or odd.


games.rb
def describe_count(games)
  if games.empty?
    "You have no games"
  elsif (games.length % 2) == 0
    "You have an even number of games"
  elsif (games.length % 2) != 0
    "You have an odd number of games"
  end
end

games = ["Super Mario Bros.", "Contra", "Metroid", "Mega Man 2"]
puts describe_count(games)


Answer:
games.rb
def describe_count(games)  
    return "You have no games" if games.empty?
    return "You have an even number of games" if games.length.even?
    return "You have an odd number of games" if games.length.odd?
end

games = ["Super Mario Bros.", "Contra", "Metroid", "Mega Man 2"]
puts describe_count(games)


Output:
You have an even number of games
