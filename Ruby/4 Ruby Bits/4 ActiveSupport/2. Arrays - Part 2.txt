2. Arrays - Part 2


We have a last_games method, but we need a first_games method as well. Use Array#to to return the list of games up to Metroid. Also change the call to first_games to take in the correct index.


games.rb
def first_games(games, index)
  
end
games = ["Super Mario Bros.", "Contra", "Metroid", "Mega Man 2"]
puts first_games(games, 0)


Answer:
games.rb
def first_games(games, index)
  games.to(index)
end
games = ["Super Mario Bros.", "Contra", "Metroid", "Mega Man 2"]
puts first_games(games, 2)


Output:
Super Mario Bros.
Contra
Metroid
