Using ActiveSupport, return the difference between Mario's favorite games and Luigi's favorite games by implementing the difference_between method.


games.rb
def difference_between(player1, player2)

end

mario_favorite = {
  sports: "Mario Sports Mix",
  action: "Super Mario World"
}

luigi_favorite = {
  sports: "Golf",
  action: "Super Mario World"
}

puts difference_between(mario_favorite, luigi_favorite)


Answer:
games.rb
def difference_between(player1, player2)
  return player1.diff(player2)
end

mario_favorite = {
  sports: "Mario Sports Mix",
  action: "Super Mario World"
}

luigi_favorite = {
  sports: "Golf",
  action: "Super Mario World"
}

puts difference_between(mario_favorite, luigi_favorite)
