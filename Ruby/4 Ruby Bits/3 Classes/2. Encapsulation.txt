2. Encapsulation


We got a little ahead of ourselves and added a has_game? method to Library that takes in the name of a game. Then, we realized that it doesn't compare year or system! Rather than passing in a game name to the has_game? method, pass in an instance of a game, and check for equality with the entire game object using the declared == method on Game.


games.rb
class Game
  attr_accessor :name, :year, :system
  attr_reader :created_at
 
  def initialize(name, options={})
    self.name = name
    self.year = options[:year]
    self.system = options[:system]
    @created_at = Time.now
  end 
  
  def ==(game)
    name == game.name && 
    system == game.system &&
    year == game.year
  end
end


library.rb
class Library
  attr_accessor :games

  def initialize(games)
    self.games = games
  end

  def has_game?(search_name)
    for game in games
      return true if game.name == search_name
    end
    false
  end
end


Answer:
library.rb
class Library
  attr_accessor :games

  def initialize(games)
    self.games = games
  end

  def has_game?(game)
    for g in games
      return true if g == game
    end
    false
  end
end
