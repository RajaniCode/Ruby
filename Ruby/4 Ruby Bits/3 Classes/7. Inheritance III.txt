7. Inheritance III


Whenever we output a game right now it'll show up using the to_s method from Object, the parent object of Game. A basic to_s implementation is completed below on Game. Override this for ConsoleGame to also show the system the game is on.


game.rb
class Game
  attr_accessor :name, :year, :system
  attr_reader :created_at
  def initialize(name, options={})
    self.name = name
    self.year = options[:year]
    self.system = options[:system]
    self.created_at = Time.now
  end
 
  def to_s
    self.name
  end
end


arcade_game.rb
class ArcadeGame < Game
  attr_accessor :weight
  def initialize(name, options={})
    super
    self.weight = options[:weight]
  end
end


console_game.rb
class ConsoleGame < Game


end


Answer:
console_game.rb
class ConsoleGame < Game
  def to_s
    string = super
    "#{string} is on : '#{self.system}'"
  end
end
