4. Private Method


Things are looking good! We're able to use our Library class to store our games now. Whenever we call add_game, let's call a new private method called log which will call puts with some information about the game that was added. Your log method should take in a string to be displayed.

game.rb
class Library
  attr_accessor :games

  def initialize(games)
    self.games = games
  end

  def has_game?(search_game)
    for game in games
      return true if game == search_game
    end
    false
  end

  def add_game(game)
    games << game
  end
end


library.rb
class Library
  attr_accessor :games

  def initialize(games)
    self.games = games
  end

  def has_game?(search_game)
    for game in games
      return true if game == search_game
    end
    false
  end

  def add_game(game)
    games << game
  end
end


Answer:
library.rb
class Library
  attr_accessor :games

  def initialize(games)
    self.games = games
  end

  def has_game?(search_game)
    for game in games
      return true if game == search_game
    end
    false
  end
   
  private
  def log(message)
    puts message
  end
  public
  def add_game(game)
    games << game
    log("Game added")
  end
end
