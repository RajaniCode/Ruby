6. Inheritance II


For our ArcadeGame class, we'll also want to track the weight of these giant cabinets taking up all of our available space. Luckily we thought ahead: we already take in an options parameter that we can stick weight into! Override the initialize method for ArcadeGame to take in the same parameters as its parent class, call super, and then set weight.


example.rb
ddr = ArcadeGame.new("Dance Dance Revolution", year: 1998, weight: 800, system: 'Bemani System 573 Analog')


game.rb
class Game
  attr_accessor :name, :year, :system
  attr_reader :created_at
 
  def initialize(name, options={})
    self.name = name
    self.year = options[:year]
    self.system = options[:system]
    @created_at = Time.now
  end
end


subclasses.rb


Answer:
subclasses.rb
class ArcadeGame < Game
  attr_accessor :weight
  def initialize(name, options = {})
    super
    self.weight = options[:weight]
  end
end
class ConsoleGame < Game
end
