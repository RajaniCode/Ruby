5. Class


Passing around hashes is getting troublesome, let's use a class to hold our data. We've started the Game class for you, now please implement the initialize method to store name, system and year in instance variables.


game.rb
class Game
  def initialize(name, options={})
  end
end


Answer:
game.rb
class Game
  def initialize(name, options={})
    @name = name
    @year = options[:year]
    @system = options[:system]
  end
end
