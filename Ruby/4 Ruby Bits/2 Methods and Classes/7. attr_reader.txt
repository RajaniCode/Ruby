7. attr_reader


When a game is initialized, store another variable called created_at which is set to Time.now in the initialize method. Make sure it can be accessed, but that it cannot be set from outside the object.


game.rb
class Game
  attr_accessor :name, :year, :system

  def initialize(name, options={})
    @name = name
    @year = options[:year]
    @system = options[:system]
  end
end


Answer:
game.rb
class Game
  attr_accessor :name, :year, :system
  attr_reader :created_at
  def initialize(name, options={})
    @name = name
    @year = options[:year]
    @system = options[:system]
    @created_at = Time.now
  end
end
