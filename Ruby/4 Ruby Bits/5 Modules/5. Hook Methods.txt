5. Hook Methods


Define a new self.included method hook for the LibraryUtils module which will extend the ClassMethods on the passed in class. Also, since we'll now be extending ClassMethods when LibraryUtils is included, remove duplicate code in the AtariLibrary class.


#file_name
module LibraryUtils

  def add_game(game)
  end

  def remove_game(game)
  end

  module ClassMethods
    def search_by_game_name(name)
    end
  end
end

class AtariLibrary
  include LibraryUtils
  extend LibraryUtils::ClassMethods
end


Answer:
#file_name
module LibraryUtils
  def self.included(base)
    base.extend(ClassMethods)
  end
    
  def add_game(game)
  end

  def remove_game(game)
  end

  module ClassMethods
    def search_by_game_name(name)
    end
  end
end

class AtariLibrary
  include LibraryUtils
end
