1. Namespacing


Create a module named GameUtils and place the lend_to_friend method inside the module. Change lend_to_friend to a class method by prefixing it with self..
You won't need to require this module since it'll be inside the same file (already required), but you will have to namespace your method call.


game.rb
class Game
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end


games.rb
def lend_to_friend(game, friend_email)
end

game = Game.new("Contra")
lend_to_friend(game, "gregg@codeschool.com")


Answer:
games.rb
module GameUtils
  def self.lend_to_friend(game, friend_email)
  end
end

game = Game.new("Contra")
GameUtils.lend_to_friend(game, "gregg@codeschool.com")
