Re-open the Game class and include the GameUtils module so its methods are exposed as instance methods. Make sure to do this before it is called.


game_utils.rb
module GameUtils
  def lend_to_friend(friend)
  end
end


game.rb
class Game
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end


games.rb
game = Game.new("contra")
game.lend_to_friend("Gregg")


Answer:
games.rb
class Game

end

game = Game.new("contra")
game.lend_to_friend("Gregg")
