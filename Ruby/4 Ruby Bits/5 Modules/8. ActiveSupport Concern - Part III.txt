8. ActiveSupport::Concern - Part III


Make sure the AtariLibrary class includes only the LibraryUtils module and let ActiveSupport::Concern take care of loading its dependencies. Then, refactor the self.included method on LibraryUtils to use the included method.


#library.rb
module LibraryLoader

  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  module ClassMethods
    def load_game_list
    end
  end
end

module LibraryUtils
  def self.included(base)
    base.load_game_list
  end
end

class AtariLibrary
  include LibraryLoader
  include LibraryUtils
end


Answer:
#library.rb
module LibraryLoader

  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  module ClassMethods
    def load_game_list
    end
  end
end

module LibraryUtils
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern
  include LibraryLoader
  included do
    load_game_list
  end
end

class AtariLibrary
  include LibraryUtils
end
