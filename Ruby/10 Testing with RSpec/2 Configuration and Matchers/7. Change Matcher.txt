7. Change Matcher


In the following example, we're checking to see that a method changes the state of a zombie. We need to make sure the zombie was in a specific state before and after the method is called.

Refactor the following example to use the expect and change syntax.


zombie.rb
class Zombie < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :iq, numericality: true
 
  def eat_brains
    self.iq += 3
  end
end


zombie_spec.rb
describe Zombie do
  it 'gains 3 IQ points by eating brains' do
    zombie = Zombie.new
    zombie.iq.should == 0
    zombie.eat_brains
    zombie.iq.should == 3
  end
end


Answer:
zombie_spec.rb
describe Zombie do
  it 'gains 3 IQ points by eating brains' do
    zombie = Zombie.new
    zombie.iq.should == 0
    zombie.eat_brains
    zombie.iq.should == 3
    expect { zombie.eat_brains }.to change { zombie.iq }.by(3)
  end
end
