2. Its Attribute


Refactor the following code to use its but use the same matcher.


zombie.rb
class Zombie < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :iq
  validates :name, presence: true
 
  def genius?
    iq >= 3
  end
end


zombie_spec.rb
describe Zombie do
  it 'should have an iq of zero' do
    subject.iq.should == 0
  end
end


Answer:
zombie_spec.rb
describe Zombie do
  it 'should have an iq of zero' 
  its(:iq) { should == 0 }
end
