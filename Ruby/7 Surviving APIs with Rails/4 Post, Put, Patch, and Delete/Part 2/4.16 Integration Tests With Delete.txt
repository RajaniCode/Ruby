4.16 Integration Tests With Delete

Now it is time to write some integration tests to ensure our API responds properly to DELETE requests to the zombies resources. Our previous developers started to write these tests before falling victim to the Zombie Apocalypse. Let’s finish it!


test/integration/deleting_zombies_test.rb
class DeletingZombiesTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  setup { @zombie = Zombie.create!(name: 'Undead Jack', brain_type: 'large') }

  test 'deletes existing zombie' do
    # your code here
  end
end


1. Issue a DELETE request to the zombie URI that points to Undead Jack.

Answer:
test/integration/deleting_zombies_test.rb
class DeletingZombiesTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  setup { @zombie = Zombie.create!(name: 'Undead Jack', brain_type: 'large') }

  test 'deletes existing zombie' do
    # your code here
    delete "/zombies/#{@zombie.id}"
  end
end


2. Assert that the response status code is 204 - No Content.


Answer:
test/integration/deleting_zombies_test.rb
class DeletingZombiesTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  setup { @zombie = Zombie.create!(name: 'Undead Jack', brain_type: 'large') }

  test 'deletes existing zombie' do
    # your code here
    delete "/zombies/#{@zombie.id}"
    assert_equal 204, response.status
  end
end
