4.5 Forgery Protection

Our API is stateless. This means we don’t need to worry about managing sessions between requests, or exceptions caused by invalid authenticity tokens.


app/controllers/application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  protect_from_forgery with: :exception
end


1. Change the protect_from_forgery method to null out the session, in case of invalid authenticity tokens.


Answer:
app/controllers/application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  protect_from_forgery with: :null_session
end
