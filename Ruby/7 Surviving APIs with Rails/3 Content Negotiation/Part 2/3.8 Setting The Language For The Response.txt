3.8 Setting The Language For The Response

With all tests in place, it is now time to implement our feature. We’ll start with a method that sets the application’s locale with the value from the Accept-Language request header.


app/controllers/application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  protect_from_forgery with: :exception
end


1. Create a controller callback that calls the set_locale method everytime a new request comes in. Define this method, but don’t worry about implementing it just yet. By following the convention for controller callback methods, mark this method as protected.

Answer:
app/controllers/application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  protect_from_forgery with: :exception
  before_action :set_locale  
  protected
  	def set_locale     
  	end
end


2. Now it is time to implement the set_locale method. This method reads from the Accept-Language request header and sets the application’s locale with the value from it.

Answer:
app/controllers/application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  protect_from_forgery with: :exception
  before_action :set_locale  
  protected
    def set_locale    
      I18n.locale = request.headers['Accept-Language']
    end
end
