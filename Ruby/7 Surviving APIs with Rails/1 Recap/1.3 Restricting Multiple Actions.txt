1.3 Restricting Multiple Actions

We’ve now changed our API to only allow listing resources for zombies, humans, medical_kits and broadcasts. Some unnecessary duplication is starting to smell, so now may be a good time to refactor our routes.


config/routes.rb
SurvivingRails::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :zombies, only: :index
  resources :humans, only: :index
  resources :medical_kits, only: :index
  resources :broadcasts, only: :index
end


1. Refactor the current routes to use the with_options method. This method takes the options as the first argument and the resources definition as a block. Remember that the block takes one argument, which you will need to use in the resources definition.

Answer:
config/routes.rb
SurvivingRails::Application.routes.draw do 
  with_options only: :index do |list_only|
    list_only.resources :zombies
    list_only.resources :humans
    list_only.resources :medical_kits
    list_only.resources :broadcasts
  end
end


2. Outside of the with_options block, create the messages resources and prohibit access to the destroy action.

Answer:
config/routes.rb
SurvivingRails::Application.routes.draw do
   with_options only: :index do |list_only|
    list_only.resources :zombies
    list_only.resources :humans
    list_only.resources :medical_kits
    list_only.resources :broadcasts
  end
  resources :messages, except: :destroy
end
