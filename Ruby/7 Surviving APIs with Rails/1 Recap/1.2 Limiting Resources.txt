1.2 Limiting Resources

Our web API is exposing endpoints for the humans and weapons resources. Currently, all operations are allowed on these resources. However, if we want to make it through the Zombie Apocalypse, we need to be extremely careful about what operations we allow.


config/routes.rb
SurvivingRails::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :humans
  resources :weapons
end


1. We cannot to allow the humans resources to be destroyed. Add the option that prevents that from happening. 

Answer:
config/routes.rb
SurvivingRails::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :humans, except: :destroy
  resources :weapons
end


2. We must limit the operations allowed on the weapons resources to :index and :show.

Answer:
config/routes.rb
SurvivingRails::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :humans, except: :destroy
  resources :weapons, only: [:index, :show]
end
