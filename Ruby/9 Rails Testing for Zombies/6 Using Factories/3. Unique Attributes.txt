3. Unique Attributes


Refactor the zombie factory using a sequence so that we get a unique name and graveyard everytime we create a new zombie.


test/factories/zombies.rb
FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :zombie do
    name 'Ash'
    graveyard 'Petrosville Cemetary'
  end
end


Answer:
test/factories/zombies.rb
FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :zombie do
    sequence(:name) { |i| "Ash#{i}" }
    sequence(:graveyard) { |i| "Petrosville Cemetary#{i}" }
  end
end
