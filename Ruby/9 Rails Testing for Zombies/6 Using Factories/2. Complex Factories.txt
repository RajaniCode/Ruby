2. Complex Factories


Use a nested Factory Girl definition to create zombie factories named :sally and :moe, using the data from the fixtures below.


test/fixtures/zombies.yml
ash:
  name: 'Ash'
  graveyard: 'Petrosville'

sally:
  name: 'Sally'
  graveyard: 'Valley Dim'

moe:
  name: 'Moe'
  graveyard: 'Petrosville'


test/factories/zombies.rb
FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :zombie do
    name 'Ash'
    graveyard 'Petrosville'
    # Add sally and moe here
  end
end


Answer:
test/factories/zombies.rb
FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :zombie do
    name 'Ash'
    graveyard 'Petrosville'

    # Add sally and moe here
    factory :sally do
      name 'Sally'
      graveyard 'Valley Dim'
    end 
    
    factory :moe do
      name 'Moe'
      graveyard 'Petrosville'
