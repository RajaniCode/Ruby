2. Error Messages


Add the custom error message One is not greater than zero to the failing assertion we just created.


test/unit/conditional_test.rb
class ConditionalTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_one_greater_than_zero
    assert 0 > 1
  end
end


Answer:
test/unit/conditional_test.rb
class ConditionalTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_one_greater_than_zero
    assert 0 > 1, "One is not greater than zero"
  end
end


Test Output:
F
