3. Test Driven Development


In a moment we are going to create the multiple_of? in our Multiple module which returns true if a number is a multiple of another number. Finish the test below, asserting that Multiple.multiple_of?(10, 5) returns true. 


test/unit/multiple_test.rb
class MultipleTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_multiple_of
    
  end
end


Answer:
test/unit/multiple_test.rb
class MultipleTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_multiple_of
    assert Multiple.multiple_of?(10, 5)
  end
end


Test Output:
.
