6.2 fresh_when


In order to save our Rails application some CPU cycles let's use the fresh_when method, passing in our @zombie model. Make it so the ETag is generated from the @zombie model rather than from the whole response body.


Database:
zombies 
id	name	weapon
1	Ash	Chainsaw
2	Bob	Bone
3	Jim	Axe


models/zombie.rb
class Zombie < ActiveRecord::Base
  def most_wanted
    where(status: 'outlaw', killed_on: nil).first
  end
end


controllers/most_wanted_controller.rb
class MostWantedController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @zombie = Zombie.most_wanted
  end
end


Answer:
controllers/most_wanted_controller.rb
class MostWantedController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @zombie = Zombie.most_wanted
    fresh_when(@zombie)
  end
end
