1.4 Match III


We enjoy living on the edge, and we have a really good reason to allow all HTTP methods for the route in our routes file. Still, Rails 4 won't allow us to do that unless we explicitly tell it so. Fix this using the via options.


config/routes.rb
ZombieOutlaws::Application.routes.draw do
  match '/undeads', to: 'undeads#index'
end


Answer:
config/routes.rb
ZombieOutlaws::Application.routes.draw do
  match '/undeads', to: 'undeads#index', via: :all
end
