The route definition in our routes file raises an error. Change the match method so that this route only responds to the POST HTTP method.


config/routes.rb
ZombieOutlaws::Application.routes.draw do
  match '/create_outlaws', to: 'zombies#create'
end


Answer:
ZombieOutlaws::Application.routes.draw do
  post '/create_outlaws', to: 'zombies#create'
end
