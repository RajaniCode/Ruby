1.6 Routing Concerns I


Looks like there's a lot of duplication in our routes file. Extract the shotguns, rifles, and knives into a concern. Name this concern defensible, and reference it from the three existing resources.


config/routes.rb
ZombieOutlaws::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :sheriffs do
    resources :shotguns
    resources :rifles
    resources :knives
  end

  resources :gunslingers do
    resources :shotguns
    resources :rifles
    resources :knives
  end

  resources :preachers do
    resources :shotguns
    resources :rifles
    resources :knives
  end
end


Answer:
config/routes.rb
ZombieOutlaws::Application.routes.draw do
  concern :defensible do
    resources :shotguns
    resources :rifles
    resources :knives
  end
  
  resources :sheriffs, concerns: :defensible
  resources :gunslingers, concerns: :defensible
  resources :preachers, concerns: :defensible
end
