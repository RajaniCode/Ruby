1.8 Thread Safety


Change the production settings in our production environment file, from an application that's being upgraded to Rails 4, so that it's threadsafe. You will need to add two new settings.


config/environments/production.rb
ZombieOutlaws::Application.configure do
  # config.threadsafe!
end


config/environments/production.rb
ZombieOutlaws::Application.configure do
  # config.threadsafe!
  config.cache_classes = true
  config.eager_load = true
end
