2.11 Relation#not


The following code uses an ugly SQL snippet to build a query that gets zombies who are not outlaws. It also has a bug when the status is 'nil', generating the wrong SQL. Fix the code so that it not only works properly, but also reads better.


models/zombie.rb
class Zombie < ActiveRecord::Base
end


Database:
zombies 
id	name	weapon	status	killed_on
1	Ash	Chainsaw	outlaw	null
2	Bob	Bone	dead	2015-07-18
3	Jim	Axe	dead	2015-07-17


zombie.rb
Zombie.where('status != ?', 'outlaw')


Answer:
zombie.rb
Zombie.where.not(status: 'outlaw')
