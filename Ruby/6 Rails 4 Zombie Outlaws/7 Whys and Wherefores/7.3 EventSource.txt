7.3 EventSource


We've added this Javascript handler for new messages, to populate the #alerts div on the alerts index page. The Javascript event handler isn't firing. The problem is somewhere in the SightingsController; can you find it?


app/views/alerts/index.html.erb
<div id="alerts">
</div>


app/assets/javascripts/sightings.js
function initialize() {
  var source = new EventSource('/sightings/alerts');
  source.addEventListener('message', function update(event) {
  var div = $('<div>').text(event.data);
    $('#alerts').append(div);
  });
};

$(document).ready(initialize);


app/controllers/sightings_controller.rb
class SightingsController < ApplicationController

  include ActionController::Live

  def alerts
    response.stream.write "data: Half-eaten brains found near saloon.\n\n"
    response.stream.write "data: Chickens disappear from farm.\n\n"
    response.stream.write "data: Zombie seen by Walker Ranch!\n\n"
    response.stream.close
  end

end


Answer:
app/controllers/sightings_controller.rb
class SightingsController < ApplicationController

  include ActionController::Live
  
  def alerts
    response.headers["Content-Type"] = "text/event-stream"
    response.stream.write "data: Half-eaten brains found near saloon.\n\n"
    response.stream.write "data: Chickens disappear from farm.\n\n"
    response.stream.write "data: Zombie seen by Walker Ranch!\n\n"
    response.stream.close
  end

end
