7.4 Turbolinks Events


We're trying to run some Javascript on page load. It's working whenever we reload the page or type in a URL directly, but when we click on a Turbolink, it doesn't. Can you get it working with Turbolinks as well?


app/assets/javascripts/sightings.js
function initialize() {
  alert('Welcome, Deputy! Check back often for new zombie sightings!');
}

$(document).ready(initialize);


Answer:
app/assets/javascripts/sightings.js
//= require turbolinks
//= require jquery.turbolinks
function initialize() {
   alert('Welcome, Deputy! Check back often for new zombie sightings!');
}
$(document).ready(initialize);
$(document).on('page:load', initialize);


#Note:
function checkAlert() {
  alert('Welcome, Deputy! Check back often for new zombie sightings!');
}
$(document).on('page:load', '#owner_active', checkAlert);
