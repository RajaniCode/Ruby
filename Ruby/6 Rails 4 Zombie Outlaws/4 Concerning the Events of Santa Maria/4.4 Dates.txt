4.4 Dates


We've added a field to track the date each Limb was found. We've been using a group of select inputs in the form, but we'd like to switch it to an input with type="date". Update the form to use a single field.


app/views/limbs/_form.html.erb
<%= form_for(@limb) do |f| %>
  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :date_found %><br />
    <%= f.date_select :date_found %>
  </div>
<% end %>


Answer:
app/views/limbs/_form.html.erb
<%= form_for(@limb) do |f| %>
  <%= f.date_field :date_found %>
<% end %>
