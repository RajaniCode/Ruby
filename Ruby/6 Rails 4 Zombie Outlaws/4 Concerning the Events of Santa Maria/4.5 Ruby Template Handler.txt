4.5 Ruby Template Handler


We need to set up a JSON view for Limbs, with the kind of limb and the name of the Zombie it belongs to. Right now the json shows only the zombie name though. Update the limbs_hash to also include the kind of each limb. Also, when the limbs.json path is accessed, have the view render limbs_hashes in JSON format.


app/controllers/limbs_controller.rb
class LimbsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @limbs = Limb.all
  end
end


Database:
zombies
id	name
1	Ash
2	Sophia
limbs 
id	zombie_id	kind
1	1	Diseased Leg
2	2	Mutant Arm


app/views/limbs/index.json.ruby
limbs_hashes = @limbs.map do |limb|
  { owner_name: limb.zombie.name }
end
# TODO: Output JSON version of limbs_hashes.


Answer:
app/views/limbs/index.json.ruby
limbs_hashes = @limbs.map do |limb|
  { owner_name: limb.zombie.name, kind: limb.kind }
end
# TODO: Output JSON version of limbs_hashes.
limbs_hashes.to_json


Output:
[{"owner_name":"Ash","kind":"Diseased Leg"},{"owner_name":"Sophia","kind":"Mutant Arm"}]
