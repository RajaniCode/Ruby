5.4 Custom Property

Some reviews might be waiting for approval. Add a custom property named approve_url to our serializer and define its respective method. This method will invoke the URL helper method approve_review_url, which expects the current object being serialized as its single argument.


review_serializer.rb
class ReviewSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :description
end


Answer:
review_serializer.rb
class ReviewSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :description
  
  def approve_url
    approve_review_url(object)
  end 
end
