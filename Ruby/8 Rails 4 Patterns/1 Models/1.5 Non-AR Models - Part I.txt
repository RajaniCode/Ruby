1.5 Non-AR Models - Part I

Let's extract some registration logic out of our controllers into a UserRegistration class. This class should take user_params as arguments to its constructor, which are used to initialize a new User (not create). This newly initialized user should be available as an attr_reader. You'll also want to move the valid_background_check? method into this new class as a private method, we'll use this later to finish creating the User.


users_controller.rb
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @user = User.new(user_params)

    if valid_background_check?
      @user.is_approved = true
    end

    if @user.save
      redirect_to @user
    else
      render :new
    end
  end

  private

  def valid_background_check?
    !!(@user.valid_ssn? || @user.valid_address?)
  end

  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email, :ssn, :address)
  end
end


user_registration.rb
class UserRegistration

  private
  # private methods go here
end


Answer:
user_registration.rb
class UserRegistration
  attr_reader :user
  def initialize(user_params)
    @user = User.new(user_params)
  end
  private
  # private methods go here
  def valid_background_check?
    !!(@user.valid_ssn? || @user.valid_address?)
  end
end
