1.8 Skinny Models I

Let's take a look at the welcome method of the User model. This method is doing way too many things, you really need to split it up into separate private methods.

Create the following private methods: send_welcome_email, enable_welcome_tour, enable_welcome_promotion. Then move the code from the welcome method into each one. Make sure to still call each method from within the welcome method.


user.rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  def welcome
    # send_welcome_email
    WelcomeMailer.welcome(self).deliver

    # enable_welcome_tour
    self.welcome_tour = true
    self.save

    # enable_welcome_promotion
    promo = Promotion.new(name: "Thanks for joining!")
    promo.set_redeemer(self)
  end
end


Answer:
user.rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  def welcome
    # send_welcome_email
    send_welcome_email

    # enable_welcome_tour
    enable_welcome_tour

    # enable_welcome_promotion
    enable_welcome_promotion
  end
  
  private 
  
  def send_welcome_email
     WelcomeMailer.welcome(self).deliver
  end
  
  def enable_welcome_tour
    self.welcome_tour = true
    self.save
  end
  
  def enable_welcome_promotion
    promo = Promotion.new(name: "Thanks for joining!")
    promo.set_redeemer(self)
  end
end
