1.9 Skinny Models II

That looks better. You can take this a step further by extracting out the welcome user functionality into a separate class similar to the UserRegistration class you created a few challenges back. This new class should accept an instance of User as an argument for the constructor. It should also have an attr_accessor for the user and a welcome method which functions the same as the original welcome method.


user.rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  def welcome
    send_welcome_email
    enable_welcome_tour
    enable_welcome_promotion
  end

  private

  def send_welcome_email
    WelcomeMailer.welcome(self).deliver
  end

  def enable_welcome_tour
    self.welcome_tour = true
    self.save
  end

  def enable_welcome_promotion
    promo = Promotion.new(name: "Thanks for joining!")
    promo.set_redeemer(self)
  end
end


user_welcome.rb
class UserWelcome

end


Answer:
user_welcome.rb
class UserWelcome
  attr_accessor :user
  
  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
  end
  
  def welcome
    send_welcome_email
    enable_welcome_tour
    enable_welcome_promotion
  end
  
  private
  
  def send_welcome_email
    WelcomeMailer.welcome(@user).deliver
  end
  
  def enable_welcome_tour
    @user.welcome_tour = true
    @user.save
  end
  
  def enable_welcome_promotion
    promo = Promotion.new(name: "Thanks for joining!")
    promo.set_redeemer(@user)
  end
end
