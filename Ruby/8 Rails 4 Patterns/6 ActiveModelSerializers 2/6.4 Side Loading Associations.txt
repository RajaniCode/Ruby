6.4 Side Loading Associations

The client-side JavaScript library we are using automatically connects side-loaded objects with their respective ids embeded in parent associations. On our ItemSerializer, let's add an option to the embed method to make sure our reviews are side-loaded.


item_serializer.rb
class ItemSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :name
  
  has_many :reviews
  embed :ids
end


Answer:
item_serializer.rb
class ItemSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :name
  
  has_many :reviews
  embed :ids, include: true
end
