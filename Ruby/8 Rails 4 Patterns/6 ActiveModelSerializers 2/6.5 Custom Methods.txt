6.5 Custom Methods

When side-loading reviews for each item, we shouldn't include those who were not yet approved. Let's override the association method reviews, in order to filter approved reviews by calling object.reviews.approved.

  
item_serializer.rb
class ItemSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :name

  has_many :reviews
  embed :ids, include: true
end


Answer:
item_serializer.rb
class ItemSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :name

  has_many :reviews
  embed :ids, include: true
  
  def reviews
    object.reviews.approved
  end
end
