7.3 Sensitive Parameters

For security purposes, our application asks a security question during sign up. Just like passwords, we can't let those answers be written to the log. Make sure we are filtering the value for security_answer.


config/application.rb
class Rails4Patterns::Application
  # hiding other config for brevity...
  config.filter_parameters += [:password]
end


Answer:
config/application.rb
class Rails4Patterns::Application
  # hiding other config for brevity...
  config.filter_parameters += [:password, :security_answer]
end


#Note:
class Rails4Patterns::Application
  # hiding other config for brevity...
  config.filter_parameters += [:password] + [:security_answer]
end
