There is an escape sequence injection vulnerability in the Basic authentication of WEBrick bundled by Ruby.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2017-10784](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-10784).

## Details

When using the Basic authentication of WEBrick, clients can pass an arbitrary string as the user name.
WEBrick outputs the passed user name intact to its log, then an attacker can inject malicious escape sequences to the log and dangerous control characters may be executed on a victim's terminal emulator.

This vulnerability is similar to [a vulnerability already fixed](/en/news/2010/01/10/webrick-escape-sequence-injection/), but it had not been fixed in the Basic authentication.

All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.

## Affected Versions

* Ruby 2.2 series: 2.2.7 and earlier
* Ruby 2.3 series: 2.3.4 and earlier
* Ruby 2.4 series: 2.4.1 and earlier
* prior to trunk revision 58453
