Hi! I’m Joe Masilotti, The Turbo Native guy. I help folks launch iOS apps in the App Store with Turbo Native and Ruby on Rails.

Way back in 2016, 37signals granted me early access to the framework and I’ve been all-in on it ever since. I’ve launched half a dozen apps for clients to the App Store and worked with twice as many on their Turbo Native apps.

Over these 7+ years I’ve learned a lot about Turbo Native. I know where it shines and where it falls short. And I’m excited to share everything I know with you!
