Mike Dalessio is the Engineering Director for Shopify’s Ruby and Rails Infrastructure team. He maintains commonly-used gems like Nokogiri, SQLite3, and Rails::HTML::Sanitizer, and has contributed to many more.

He’s a member of the Rails Triage and Rails Security teams and has developed a very particular set of skills around C extensions, HTML sanitization, and debugging segfaults.

Previously he led the Cloud Foundry open source PaaS project for VMware and Pivotal. In 2009 he coined the phrase “WWSMD?” (IYKYK).

He likes coffee, intimate chats, and long walks, and has been known to combine all three.
