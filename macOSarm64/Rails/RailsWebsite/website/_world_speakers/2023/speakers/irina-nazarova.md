Some people have a clear destiny, some donâ€™t. During the first 30 years of her life, Irina founded two startups, earned degrees in CS and Data Analysis, and embraced a range of occupations, from being a C++ engineer and investment bank research analyst to a studio photographer, product manager, writer, and financial consultant. Little did she know every step of her path was subtly guiding her towards her ultimate destiny. Now, armed with wit, passion, and a sprinkle of mischief, she proudly steers Evil Martians toward extraordinary achievements.
