Jorge is a programmer who loves building things and messing with every part of the process. In love with Rails since the early days, he is the author of Active Record Encryption and is a regular author in the 37signals dev blog. Outside of work, he loves being a dad, reading a good book on the beach, writing, and planning to exercise without really exercising much.
