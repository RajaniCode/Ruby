I’m a Staff Engineer on Intercom’s Datastores team (which owns all core technologies, including Rails) and have worked here for 6 years as of June 2023. In that time I’ve seen a lot of big and exciting changes, and long the way I’ve become Intercom’s expert on ActiveRecord. In recent times I lead a project to ensure the long term scalability of our MySQL databases with horizontal sharding with lots of low level work at the application layer to make it as seamless as possible for engineers.
