I am Julia López from Barcelona! I’ve been a Rails developer since 2011 and I love it. I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Harvest where I had the chance to participate in many Rails upgrades – I am obsessed with upgrading things so I **never** miss those opportunities – After the conference talks, you can find me at the Karaoke events!
