We have a lot of good news coming this week, and this is just the start: <a href="https://gusto.com/">Gusto</a>, a leading provider of HR, payroll, and benefits solutions, and a big supporter of the Rails community, has joined the Rails Foundation as its newest Contributing member! 

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px"><img src="/assets/images/logo-gusto.svg" style="width: 50%"></p>

Gusto was founded in 2011 as ZenPayroll and rebranded in 2015 as they extended their focus from payroll to include health benefits and workers’ compensation services and more. Along the way, they have grown to around 3,000 employees with hundreds of Rails developers.

Gusto’s codebase is largely divided into two majestic monoliths. They’ve leaned into gradual modularization by adopting <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/packwerk">packwerk</a> and have contributed to the surrounding ecosystem with their <a href="https://github.com/rubyatscale">rubyatscale</a> tooling that helps to divide codebases into domain-based packages and helps to encapsulate private complexity behind public interfaces.

Internally, Gusto encourage and promote open source contributions via an open source guild, having recently <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/rubocop-sorbet/pull/263">upstreamed some rubocop rules</a>, <a href="https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/pull/879">improved the performance of lefthook</a>, <a href="https://blog.rubygems.org/2024/05/30/bundler-auto-install-just-got-a-whole-lot-better.html">improved auto-install</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commits/master/?author=technicalpickles">the performance of bundler</a>, and continued to maintain <a href="https://github.com/Gusto/buildkite-builder">buildkite-builder</a> that Rails itself uses for its build pipeline. Gusto’s Head of Security maintains <a href="https://brakemanscanner.org/">Brakeman</a>, a static analysis security tool also used in Rails for checking security issues in your application.

In addition to this open source work, Gusto also <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Gusto/sponsoring">sponsors</a> individual open source contributors whose work they build on top of. They have also started to sponsor <a href="https://boulder-ruby.org/">Boulder Ruby Group</a> to help grow the Ruby developer community, and have hosted Women Who Code events at their Denver, New York City, and San Francisco offices.

Gusto’s contributions to Rails and its commitment to fostering the open-source ecosystem align perfectly with the Foundation’s mission, and once again we are reminded of the impact that companies dedicated to open source can have on the broader community. 

We are excited to have Gusto onboard, and we look forward to collaborating for years to come!
