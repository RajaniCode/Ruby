[Rails World](https://rubyonrails.org/world) is in a couple of days, and Rails 7.1 has now entered the Release Candidate
phase. This means that we are now feature complete, and we will only be fixing bugs and improving documentation,
with the target of releasing the final version of Rails 7.1 on October 5nd.

Since the Release of the [7.1.0.beta1](https://rubyonrails.org/2023/9/13/Rails-7-1-0-beta-1-has-been-released) we had a
few new changes and improvements that can be viewed in the CHANGELOGs for
[7.1.0.rc1](https://github.com/rails/rails/releases/tag/v7.1.0.rc1) and
[7.1.0.rc2](https://github.com/rails/rails/releases/tag/v7.1.0.rc2).

We also create a [new category in the Rails forum](https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/c/rails-upgrades/upgrade-from-7-0-to-7-1/15)
for people to share their experiences upgrading their applications to 7.1, share solutions, and ask questions.

As always, we would like to thank all the [over 800 contributors](https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/edge/contributors)
who helped with this release a reality and all users that tested the beta and release candidates and reported issues.
