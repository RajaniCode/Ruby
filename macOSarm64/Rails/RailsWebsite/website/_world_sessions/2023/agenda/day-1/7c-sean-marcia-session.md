Presented by Cynthia Lo and Sean Marcia. This workshop will be given once per day.

Are you intrigued by all the chatter around AI-powered tools like ChatGPT and CoPilot? Then our workshop is the perfect place for you to learn and understand these tools hands-on. We’ll walk through practical applications of these tools and you’ll be using them to add features, tests, and fix bugs in a real-world application – no contrived demos here!

Don’t forget to bring your laptop to this workshop, as there is no better way to learn than by doing. And you’ll definitely be doing!

Note: Registration for this workshop will open in September, and space is limited.

To participate, advance registration and setup is required. Workshop attendees will be invited to a GitHub repo and given free access to Copilot for this workshop. Before the workshop begins, you will need to install vscode and the correct versions of Ruby, Rails, and other various gems. The workshop presenters will send all registered attendees instructions before Rails World.
