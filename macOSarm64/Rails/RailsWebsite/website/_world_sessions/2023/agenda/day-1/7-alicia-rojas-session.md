Rails applications can be easily enhanced with PWA (Progressive Web Applications) functionalities thanks to the latest changes on the way the client-side is managed. This creates a great opportunity to reach non-conventional audiences (i.e.: people that lack a stable internet connection), and generate a positive impact in their lives with creative solutions.

In this session, you will learn how to turn your regular Rails application into a PWA, allowing it to provide functionality under different network conditions. Most code samples belong to a case study of an application conceived for rural people living in areas lacking stable internet access, such as farmers and agricultural technicians. We will cover exciting stuff such as caching and providing an offline fallback, how to make your app installable, and performing offline CRUD actions with IndexedDB and Hotwire.
