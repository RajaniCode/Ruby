We’ve always been told that the right way to style our sites is to keep presentational details out of our markup, and safely encapsulate them in our stylesheets instead. But if this is the right way to build websites, why are our stylesheets always the first thing to spiral out of control into an unmaintainable 800kb mess that everyone on the team is afraid to change?

In this talk, you’ll learn why “separation of concerns” isn’t the right way to think about the relationship between HTML and CSS, why presentational class names lead to code that’s so much easier to maintain, as well as loads of tips, tricks, and best practices for getting the most out of Tailwind CSS, directly from the creator himself.
