An unbelievable amount of features are packed into Rails making it one of the most powerful web frameworks you can use. So let’s take a look at some little known, underused, and new things in Rails 7.

A few of the topics we’ll cover:

- ActiveRecord features like “excluding”, strict_loading, virtual columns, with_options, attr_readonly, etc
- ActiveStorage named variants
- ActionText embedding any database record
- Saving ActionMailbox inbound emails in ActionText
- Routing constraints like the “(un)authenticated” helpers in Devise
- Overriding generator templates like scaffolds to add your own features
- Custom Turbo Stream Actions with Hotwire
- Turbo Native authentication with your Rails backend
- ActiveSupport features like truncate_words
- Rails 7.1’s new features: authentication, normalizes, logging background enqueue callers, and more.
