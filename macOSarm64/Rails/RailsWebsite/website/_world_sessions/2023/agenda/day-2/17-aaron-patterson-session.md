What would development be like if Rails had tight integration with Language Servers? In this presentation we’ll look at how language servers work, how we can improve language server support in Rails, and how this will increase our productivity as Rails developers. We’ll dive in to the implementation details of a language server, what needs to be done in Rails to support language servers, and how we as Rails developers can make better use of LSPs to boost our productivity.
