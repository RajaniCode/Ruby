Rails 7.1 improved Railsâ€™s security posture and made Rails more friendly with modern browsers by shipping HTML5-compliant sanitizers by default.

This is the story of planning and executing a complex migration task on a major open-source project, a multi-year journey that started in 2015 with a security vulnerability and ended after coordinating major changes to Action View, Rails::HTML::Sanitizer, Loofah, and Nokogiri, and taking over maintenance of libgumbo.

Along the way two active open-source projects merged, an entire class of XSS vulnerabilities was rendered inert, and I came to admire the unlikely brilliance of the HTML5 parser specification.
