RubyGems is the Ruby community’s go to package manager. It hosts over 175 thousand gems – one of which is Rails and others that we use to customize our applications. RubyGems and Bundler does an excellent job in removing the complexities of gem resolution and installation so developers can focus on building great software.

In this talk, we’ll be taking a look at the inner workings of the Ruby package ecosystem. This includes:

- The processes involved in installing gems from a Gemfile
- Insights into debugging gems within a Rails application
- Ensuring you’re selecting the right gems to avoid security risks
