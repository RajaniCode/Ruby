Turbo Native gives Rails developers superpowers. It enables us to launch low maintenance but high-fidelity hybrid apps across multiple platforms. All while keeping the core business logic where it matters - in the Ruby code running on the server.

The framework renders your existing mobile web HTML inside of a native “shell.” But getting started isn’t easy. You still have to write some native Swift code in Xcode. And there isn’t much documentation available about the right way to do things.

During this talk I’ll walk you through all of that. You’ll learn how to build a Turbo Native iOS app from scratch along with the benefits and pain points that come with it. We’ll dive into ways to make the app feel more native, how to integrate with native Swift SDKs, and more.
