Ruby on Rails was the hottest technology web development had ever seen. It became a staple technology for web developers.

But things changed.

Single-page web applications and microservices became the standard. Server-rendered monoliths were out of style; Rails was out of style.

The community persisted, but the excitement was missing. We put our heads down and continued to build applications using the tools and technology we love. We continued doing so while people mocked Rails for being slow and dead.

Eventually, the tide turned- and Rails excited developers again. Today, people are excited to build new applications with Ruby on Rails.

Let's celebrate the resurgence and explore how we can contribute to the movement.
