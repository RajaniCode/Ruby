        <p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2024/8/6/Rails-7-2-0-rc-1-has-been-released">yesterday’s 7.2 announcement</a>, we have more good news: the <a href="/world/2024">Rails World</a> agenda is live, and we added a last-minute session to the program that we think you are going to love: Ruby creator <strong>Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto</strong> will join us at Rails World in Toronto as a special guest of Shopify and the Rails Foundation.</p>

<p><strong>Matz &amp; DHH, together on stage for the first time</strong></p>

<p>To close day one, Matz and DHH will share the stage for the very first time for a <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/world/2024/day-1/closing-keynote">fireside chat</a> about Ruby, Rails and all things open source. This special conversation will be moderated and hosted by Shopify founder and early Rails Core member Tobias Lütke.</p>

<p>We are beyond excited that Matz has found time in his epic conference schedule to join us for this chat. This is definitely a session that you don’t want to miss!</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/world/2024/agenda/day-1">the full Rails World agenda here</a>, and don’t forget that <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2024/8/1/building-the-rails-world-app-with-telos-labs">Telos Labs is creating the Rails World app</a>, so attendees will soon be able to build their personal schedule.</p>

<p>Still more updates coming soon, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>**</p>

<p><a href="/world/2024">Rails World</a> takes place September 26 &amp; 27, 2024 at Evergreen Brickworks in Toronto, Canada. It is currently sold out, but those wishing to join the waiting list can email <a href="mailto:world@rubyonrails.org">world@rubyonrails.org</a>, and we will see what we can do!</p>
