        <p><a href="/world/2024">Rails World 2024</a> (Sept 26 &amp; 27, Toronto) is just around the corner, and we have <em>a lot</em> of news to share with you in the coming days, including speaker updates, sponsor news, and a little bit of what to expect while on site.</p>

<p>But first: a special Rails World partnership with <a href="https://hi.teloslabs.co/">Telos Labs</a>.</p>

<p>Telos Labs stepped up this year and offered to build the Rails World 2024 app, and development is already underway. The app will have all the features you need in an event app, including an overview of the conference agenda, the ability to create your own personal agenda, notifications when a session is about to begin, and a personal profile with your bio and social links.</p>

<p><strong>A gift for the community</strong></p>

<p>This initiative is particularly special because Telos Labs is not just building the app for this edition of Rails World - in the spirit of Ruby and Rails, they are open-sourcing it and gifting it to the <em>entire community</em>.</p>

<p>Any of the (many!) events in the Ruby space are invited to use this app at their own events and improve on it for years to come. We hope it can also serve as a great starter project for junior developers looking to get involved in open source.</p>

<p>Thank you, Telos Labs, for this awesome gift!</p>

<p><strong>Follow along</strong></p>

<p>Telos Labs is sticking to the Rails way in their development process, creating a PWA using a full-stack pattern with <strong>Stimulus</strong>, <strong>Turbo</strong>, <strong>Solid Queue</strong>, and <strong>Kamal</strong> for deployments. Where possible, dependencies will also be built on Rails, with <a href="https://avohq.io">AvoHQ</a> for the admin dashboard, <a href="https://mailpace.com">MailPace</a> for transactional emails, and <a href="https://www.appsignal.com">AppSignal</a> for monitoring (AppSignal is a Platinum sponsor again at Rails World this year, and they have generously provided free monitoring for this project).</p>

<p>For the next few weeks, they will be building in public and you are invited to follow along as things progress. Even if you are not attending Rails World this year, weâ€™d love your feedback and suggestions.</p>

<p><strong>You can find a sneak peek of the app and links to the repo over in the <a href="https://hi.teloslabs.co/post/rails-world-2024-conference-app">Telos Labs blog</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Stay tuned for more Rails World updates as we countdown to September. We have so much more to share!</p>
