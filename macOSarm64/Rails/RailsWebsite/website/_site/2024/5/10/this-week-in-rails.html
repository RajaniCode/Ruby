        <p>Hi, <a href="https://twitter.com/morgoth85">Wojtek</a> here. Let’s explore this week’s changes in the Rails.</p>

<p><a href="https://railsdeveloper.com/survey/">The bi-annual Rails community survey is live!</a><br />
Your input is invaluable and will help the team at Planet Argon gather insight on the current state of the Rails community. <a href="https://railsdeveloper.com/survey/">Fill in the survey here</a>. (And feel free to share with your teams).
The survey will remain open until August 2nd, 2024, and the findings released shortly thereafter.</p>

<p><a href="https://rubycentral.org/news/anewearforrubycentralevents/">A New Era for Ruby Central Events</a><br />
Ruby Central announced that 2025 will be the last year of <em>RailsConf</em> and they are inviting the community to vote on where the last edition should be held. <a href="https://rubycentral.org/news/anewearforrubycentralevents/">Read the full announcement here</a>, and cast your vote.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/48727">Fix index_errors and provide :nested_attributes_order mode</a><br />
This indexes the association validation errors based on the order received by nested attributes setter, and respects the <em>reject_if</em> configuration.
This enables API to provide enough information to the frontend to map the validation errors back to their respective form fields.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/51686">Add flag to speed up multi-process test runs</a><br />
Add <em>ENV[“SKIP_TEST_DATABASE_TRUNCATE”]</em> flag to speed up multi-process test runs on large databases, when all tests run within default transaction.
This cuts ~10 seconds from the test run of HEY when run by 24 processes against the 178 tables, since ~4,000 table truncates can then be skipped.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/51770">Replace allocations count by GC time in request logs</a><br />
Allocations count is often an interesting proxy for performance, but not necessarily the most relevant thing to include in request logs, given they aren’t a per thread metric, so the reporting is widely inaccurate in multi-threaded environments.</p>

<p>Since Ruby 3.1 there is now <em>GC.total_time</em> which is a monotonically increasing counter of time spent in GC. It still isn’t really a per thread metric, but it is more interesting because it uses the same unit as the response time, allowing to better see when you have a GC pause performance issue.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/51751">Explain that the default Dockerfile is intended for production</a><br />
If people want to use Docker in development, they’d need a radically different setup, and are likely much better served by dev containers.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/51718">Don’t mess with Minitest unless RAILS_ENV is set</a><br />
Minitest will automatically scan all installed gems and load plugins from those gems.  We should detect whether or not we’re being run within the context of a Rails app and only change MT behavior in that case.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/51571">Warn about changing “query_constraints” behavior</a><br />
Add a deprecation warning for the <em>query_constraints:</em> association option. This option will change behavior in the future versions of Rails and applications are encouraged to switch to <em>foreign_key:</em> to preserve the current behavior.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/48585">Consistently use desired test adapter in Active Job</a><br />
All tests now respect the <em>active_job.queue_adapter</em> config, which previously was not always the case.</p>

<p><em>You can view the whole list of changes <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/@%7B2024-05-03%7D...main@%7B2024-05-10%7D">here</a>.</em>
<em>We had <a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20240503-20240510">20 contributors</a> to the Rails codebase this past week!</em></p>

<p>Until next time!</p>
