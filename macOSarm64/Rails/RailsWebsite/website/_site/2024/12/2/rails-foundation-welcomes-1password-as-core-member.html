        <p>The Rails Foundation is growing! After 2 years, we have made great strides in fulfilling our mission, but there is still more we want to accomplish. With that in mind, at a recent board meeting, the board voted in favor of expanding the number of Core members and seats on the board.</p>

<p>Founded in 2022 by Core members <a href="https://cookpad.com/">Cookpad</a>, <a href="https://www.doximity.com/">Doximity</a>, <a href="https://www.fleetio.com/">Fleetio</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.intercom.com/">Intercom</a>, <a href="https://www.procore.com/">Procore</a>, <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a>, and <a href="https://37signals.com/">37signals</a>, the Rails Foundation has since welcomed 7 other Contributing members, and enjoyed two years of operations, including two successful Rails Worlds, an ongoing documentation project, and a host of other initiatives.</p>

<p>Expanding Core membership means a stronger foundation with more long-term growth and sustainability, and most importantly: more support for the Rails community.</p>

<p>With that news, we are happy to announce that our first new Core member is none other than <strong><a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a></strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px"><img src="/assets/images/logo-1password.svg" style="width: 50%" /></p>

<p>1Password has a strong connection with Rails, leveraging the framework to build Kolide, its Device Trust product <a href="https://www.kolide.com/blog/1password-acquires-kolide">acquired earlier this year</a> and now integrated into <a href="https://1password.com/extended-access-management">1Password’s Extended Access Management (XAM) platform</a>. Kolide ensures that devices meet strict security criteria before accessing critical applications. This Rails-powered application handles thousands of web requests per second, authorizes millions of authentication attempts, processes billions of asynchronous jobs each month, and consistently delivers four nines of annual uptime for customers such as Databricks, Discord, Anduril, Robinhood, Hugging Face, Asana, and many others.</p>

<p>Beyond its own use of Rails, 1Password has already made meaningful contributions to the community. This includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7zo-wnvcLs">giving talks</a> to share insights, <a href="https://blog.1password.com/1password-rails-kindred-spirits/#how-to-use-kamal-2-and-1password">creating tutorials</a> to help developers leverage Rails effectively, and <a href="https://developer.1password.com/docs/web/compatible-website-design">providing resources</a> to tackle security challenges with confidence. Contributions to Rails itself include <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49241">submitting improvements</a> and <a href="https://blog.1password.com/new-developer-experience/">building tools</a> that simplify development, deployment, and security for software creators, organizations, and end users alike.</p>

<p>Representing 1Password on the board of the Rails Foundation is VP of Product, <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-meller-04498230/">Jason Meller</a></strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Joining the Rails Foundation is about more than just using the framework; it’s about aligning with a community that shares our values. Rails represents speed of execution, craftsmanship, and care for the end user—principles we live by at 1Password. 
We’re excited to deepen our partnership with Rails through the Foundation and look forward to contributing to initiatives like security focused documentation and developer education, which are critical to Rails’ ongoing success.
<br /><br /><em>Jason Meller, VP, Product, 1Password</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>On behalf of the board, we welcome 1Password to the Rails Foundation, and look forward to working together in 2025 and beyond.</p>

<p>By the way, 1Password is looking for talented Rails developers. If you share their passion for innovation and community, check out their recent open role <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/1password/96088bd5-a20e-4624-a24e-97fb065e971f">here</a>.</p>

<p>Stay tuned as we continue to share updates on our expanded Core membership and new education initiatives landing soon.</p>
