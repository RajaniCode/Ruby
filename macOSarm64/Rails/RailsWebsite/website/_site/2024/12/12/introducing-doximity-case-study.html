        <p>Today, the Rails Foundation is releasing the first of many case studies that will showcase how companies use and build with Rails. To kick off this series, we’re highlighting the story of why <a href="https://www.doximity.com/">Doximity</a> chose Rails in 2010, and how they’ve been building and scaling their original monolith successfully for the past 15 years.</p>

<p>Doximity is the leading digital platform for U.S. medical professionals. Their mission is to help doctors provide better care to their patients by providing tools that help streamline communication, collaboration, and clinical workflow, including telehealth. Over the past 15 years, they’ve grown to serve more than two million healthcare professionals, including more than 80% of U.S. doctors.</p>

<p>In this case study, you’ll read how they used Rails to move fast, iterate quickly in response to customer feedback, and evolve their monolith, all while navigating the additional challenges of scaling a critical platform quickly during a global pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>Read the case study: <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/docs/case-studies/doximity">Fast, Flexible, and Scalable: How Rails Powers Doximity’s Healthcare Platform</a></strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/case-study-doximity-app.png" /></p>

<p><em>Big thanks to Doximity’s engineering leadership who took an active part in sharing their story, and a big shout out to Robby Russell and his team at Planet Argon for getting this first case study written and shipped.</em></p>

<p><strong>Why we’re sharing these stories</strong></p>

<p>If you’re a seasoned Rails developer, you’re probably not the primary audience for these stories - you already know the joy and power of Rails. You work with it every day!</p>

<p>But the Rails Foundation exists to show the world that Rails is an excellent choice for building fast, flexible, and scalable applications. And what better way to do that than by telling the stories of companies like Doximity, who have done exactly that? Case studies like these offer real-world examples of how Rails empowers even small teams to deliver big results so businesses can focus on what matters: growing the business, meeting customer needs, adding new features.</p>

<p>So these stories are for those outside our community: entrepreneurs, engineers from other languages, technical decision-makers, and potential founders who might not yet see what Rails can offer. We want to show them the speed and agility Rails brings to startups, the scalability that powers platforms like Doximity (and so many others), and the ability to grow your idea with confidence “from Hello World to IPO” on a solid foundation that’s been thriving for over 20 years.</p>

<p>With Rails, the possibilities are endless, and we have a lot of stories to tell. And maybe, just maybe, these stories will inspire others with a vision, or a dream, or a new idea for the next big thing.</p>

<p>Stay tuned. More case studies coming next year.</p>
