      <div class="post__content common-content common-content--post">
        <p>Last week, we published a bunch of <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2024/12/12/introducing-doximity-case-study">new</a> and <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2024/12/13/learn-Rails-8-tutorial-and-unpacked-videos">updated</a> resources to help you learn Rails and learn how companies leverage Rails to build successful businesses. But we also made a few structural and navigational changes to the website that you may not have noticed (yet).</p>

<p><strong>The challenge: lots of resources, little space</strong></p>

<p>Earlier this year, we had big plans:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a new flagship tutorial (with more planned soon).</li>
  <li>Extract the Rails installation instructions from the tutorial into a standalone Installation Guide (because you shouldn’t have to find this information buried in chapter 3 of a tutorial).</li>
  <li>Publish the first case study (with more planned soon).</li>
  <li>On top of all that, launch a merch store.</li>
</ul>

<p>We were excited that all this was coming, but the navbar was already quite crowded…<em>where were all these new resources going to live?</em></p>

<p><strong>The solution: a unified Docs landing page</strong></p>

<p>Introducing <strong><a href="/docs">Docs</a></strong>, the friendly new starting point for everything you need to install Rails, learn it, get better at it, and get involved.</p>

<p>From one convenient page, you can now access the following: Installation Guide, Tutorials, Guides, API Docs, Case Studies, the Forum, and the Contributing Guide.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/docs-landing-page.png" /></p>

<p>Other changes you might notice in the navbar:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We’ve renamed ‘Contribute’ to <strong>Source</strong> to clarify the difference between the GitHub repository and the Contributing Guide. (We also made the <strong>Contributing Guide</strong> easier to find. Rails is an open-source project, but this important info was buried 85% down the Guides index page. It’s now featured more prominently on the Docs landing page.)</li>
  <li>‘Team’ is now called <strong>Community</strong>, where you can find all of the Rails teams and the Contributors site. This renaming also balances out the navbar.</li>
  <li>The ‘Blog’ is now called <strong>News</strong> since it also contains Rails Foundation news alongside Rails updates and This Week in Rails newsletters.</li>
  <li>With <strong>Guides</strong>, <strong>API docs</strong>, and the <strong>Forum</strong> now nested under <strong>Docs</strong>, this gave us room in the navbar to add 
<strong>Merch</strong> and <strong>Events</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These changes aim to make the Rails website more welcoming and friendly-to-navigate for beginners, while helping you, as a more experienced Rails dev, find what you need quickly. This (re)structure also gives the Rails Foundation a clear home for future tutorials and case studies, so expect more of those released next year.</p>

<p><a href="/docs">Take a look at the new Docs page</a> and let us know what you think!</p>

<p>The Docs landing page was designed and shipped by <a href="https://www.meticulous.com/">John Athayde</a> with feedback and direction from the <strong>Rails Core</strong>, <strong>Issues</strong>, and <strong>Committers</strong> teams, and made possible by the support of the <strong>members of the Rails Foundation</strong>. Thank you to everyone involved for your input!</p>
