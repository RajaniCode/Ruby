        <p>Hi, it’s <a href="https://greg.molnar.io">Greg</a>. Let’s explore this week’s changes in the Rails codebase.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52093">Only sanitize <em>content</em> attribute when present in attachments</a><br />
A recent security fix introduced sanitizing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content</code> attribute
of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ActionText::Attachable::ContentAttachment</code>. As a side effect it always
sets the attribute, even when it’s missing, causing Trix to not show
the image preview. This pull request fixes that issue.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52086">Bring back <em>puma.rb</em> to target of <em>app:update</em></a><br />
Because Rails has improved <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">puma.rb</code> in the past a few times, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rails app:update</code>
will update the file in the future releases.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52080">Define the a <em>start_transaction.active_record</em> event</a><br />
With this change, a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start_transaction.active_record</code> event will be emitted
when a transaction has been started. This event complements
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transaction.active_record</code>, which is triggered when they finish.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/51761">Add <em>filter</em> option on <em>in_order_of</em></a><br />
This pull request adds a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filter</code> option to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">in_order_of</code> in Active Record to
prioritize certain values in the sorting without filtering the results by these
values. The same change was done to Enumerable as well in
<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52072">52072</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49240">Add an internal route for bin/rails notes</a><br />
This pull request adds an internal route <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rails/info/notes</code> to display the same
information you would get from running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/rails notes</code> so we can check the
notes on UI.</p>

<em>We had <a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20240607-20240614">37 contributors</a> to the Rails codebase this past week!</em></p>
