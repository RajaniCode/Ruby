        <p>Amid the work taking place to improve the Rails documentation and prepare for Rails World, we are happy to take a break and introduce the newest Contributing member of the Rails Foundation: <a href="https://tablecheck.com/en/join">TableCheck</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px"><img src="/assets/images/logo-tablecheck.svg" style="width: 50%" /></p>

<p>TableCheck is a restaurant booking and guest experience platform serving over 10,000 venues across 35 countries, including many of the world’s largest hospitality brands. Headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, TableCheck helps restaurants reduce their reliance on paid booking channels by converting first-time diners into repeat guests—and repeat guests into loyal fans.</p>

<p>TableCheck was founded by CEO Yu Taniguchi and CTO Johnny Shields and has used Rails since its initial product launch in 2013. TableCheck’s engineers maintain dozens of Rails-related Ruby gems, notably making over 200 contributions to the ‘Mongoid’ object-document mapper gem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rails has been a reliable platform to grow our business, both in terms of continually shipping product enhancements to customers, and hiring and onboarding new developers. 11 years into our Rails journey we continue to double-down on our investment in the framework, and we’re thrilled to join the Rails Foundation as our latest step.
<br /><br /><em>Johnny Shields, TableCheck Founder &amp; CTO</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We thank TableCheck for supporting the Rails community, and we are excited to welcome the first company in Hospitality Tech to join the Rails Foundation!</p>
