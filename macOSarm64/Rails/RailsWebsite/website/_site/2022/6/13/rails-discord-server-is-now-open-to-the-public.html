        <p>In the past few weeks, the Rails team has been working on a few changes to lower the barrier for new contributors to the framework.</p>

<p>We started by <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/acf48169943011834c4c885b956e29050548fa98">disabling the automatic closing of stale PRs</a>. While initially this automation helped the project keep the issues tracker under control, nowadays things are better and we prefer to go back to full human interaction.</p>

<p>To make it easier for contributors to recognize all the members of the Rails team, we made public the <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/community">list
of current members of the Issues team</a>. The Issues team assists with
issues triage, pull request reviews and documentation improvements, so they are often the first
interaction users have with the Rails team.</p>

<p>Today, we are opening a Discord server to allow contributors to help each other and lower the overhead
of communicating with new contributors.</p>

<p>This new server is open to the public using <a href="https://discord.gg/d8N68BCw49">this invite link</a>,
and is a great place to get help on how to contribute to the framework and its related libraries.
This server will not be a support channel for the framework. For support, we will
continue to use the <a href="https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/c/rubyonrails-talk/7">Ruby on Rails talk category</a>
in the Discourse forum. Complementing those channels, we will have the
<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a> for issue and pull requests and our
<a href="https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/c/rubyonrails-core/5">Ruby on Rails Core category</a> for larger
discussions about features and possible contributions.</p>

<p>The Discord server will follow the same <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/conduct">Code Of Conduct</a> as the rest of the Rails official spaces.</p>

<p>We hope to see you there!</p>
