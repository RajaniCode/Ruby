        <p>Hi, this is Petrik, bringing you the latest news from the Rails world.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/44495"><strong>Reduce the output of Rails::Railtie#inspect to the classname</strong></a><br />
Anytime <em>inspect</em> was called on <em>Rails::Application</em>, it would output the very large application object. By reducing it to the classname, we also prevent leaking credentials.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/44554"><strong>Remove body content from redirect responses</strong></a></p>

<p>Modern browsers don’t render the body content for redirects. The delivered bytes are therefore a small waste.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/44439"><strong>Return the blob/blobs when #attach is able to save the record</strong></a></p>

<p>Saving attachments to a record with the <em>attach</em> method returns the blob or array of blobs that were attached to the record.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/43688"><strong>Support password challenge via has_secure_password</strong></a></p>

<p>This allows a password challenge to be implemented with the same ease as a password confirmation, re-using the same error handling logic in the view, as well as the controller.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/44635"><strong>Generate Content Security Policy headers for non-HTML responses</strong></a></p>

<p>The content security policy DSL would not generate headers for non-HTML responses, even if a configuration is explicitly provided. However, for example, <a href="https://observatory.mozilla.org/faq/">Mozilla Observatory</a> recommends adding it for API responses as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/44085"><strong>Extend audio_tag and video_tag to accept Active Storage attachments</strong></a></p>

<p>Now it’s possible to write <em>video_tag(user.video_file)</em> instead of <em>video_tag(polymorphic_path(user.video_file)).</em></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/44617"><strong>Add active_record.destroy_association_async_batch_size configuration</strong></a></p>

<p>This allows applications to specify the maximum number of records that will be destroyed in a single background job by the <em>dependent: :destroy_async</em> association option. If the number of dependent records is greater than this configuration, the records will be destroyed in multiple background jobs.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/44707"><strong>Auto-create user and grant privileges when creating mysql databases</strong></a><br />
Creating the database user and granting privileges every time you need to set up Rails locally on a new computer can be tedious. This change adds it to the MySQL build rake task, using the <em>root</em> user with no password.</p>

<p>Since last time, <a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20220212-20220222">36 people</a> contributed to Rails. As usual, there’s too much changes to cover them but you can check out all of these <a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20220212-20220221">here</a>. Until next time!</p>
