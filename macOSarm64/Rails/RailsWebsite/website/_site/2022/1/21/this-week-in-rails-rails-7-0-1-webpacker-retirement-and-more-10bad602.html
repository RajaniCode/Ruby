        <p>Hi, <a href="https://twitter.com/morgoth85">Wojtek</a> here introducing you to this year changes in the Rails.</p>

<p><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2022/1/6/Rails-7-0-1-has-been-released"><strong>Released Rails 7.0.1</strong></a><br />
The Ruby 3.1 is fully supported with this release. It also contains few bug fixes and documentation improvements.</p>

<p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/rails/status/1483772667756957699"><strong>Retirement of Webpacker</strong></a><br />
Only security issues will be considered and there will be no version 6 release of Webpacker. There is a <a href="https://github.com/rails/jsbundling-rails/blob/main/docs/switch_from_webpacker.md">switching guide to jsbundling-rails</a> ready.<br />
Thank you to everyone who’ve contributed to Webpacker over the last five-plus years!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/44133"><strong>Autoloaded paths are no longer in load path</strong></a><br />
Starting from Rails 7.1, all paths managed by the autoloader will no longer be added to <em>$LOAD_PATH</em>.<br />
This means it won’t be possible to load them with a manual <em>require</em> call, the class or module can be referenced instead.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/44141"><strong>Added update_attributes! to Active Record</strong></a><br />
Similar to <em>update_attribute</em>, but raises <em>ActiveRecord::RecordNotSaved</em> when a <em>before_*</em> callback throws <em>:abort</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20220101-20220121">61 people</a> contributed to Rails since the last time. All the changes can be checked <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/@%7B2022-01-01%7D...main@%7B2022-01-21%7D">here</a>. Until next week!</p>
