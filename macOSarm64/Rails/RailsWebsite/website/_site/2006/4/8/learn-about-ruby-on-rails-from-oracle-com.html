Michael Schoen in particular has done a fantastic job. He has set up an automated testing server for Oracle, so any new revision of the framework is automatically tested and run against Oracle. If any failure occurs, an email is sent out.We invite guys working with DB2, MS SQL, Sybase, and the other commercial databases to do the same." />
