  <meta name="description" content="Due to the overwhelming success of selling 400 seats in just a week, RailsConf has been able to extend the venue and open up an additional 150 seats. So if you missed out during the first round of registrations, now would be a very good time to expedite that intention to be there and sign up. Hope to see you in Chicago in June!UPDATE: Away they went! The additional 150 seats have been sold in a little less than 24 hours and we&#8217;re thus full. We&#8217;re going to have one hell of a time with 550 Railers in the room. Awesome!" />
