I don&#8217;t work on Rails to please other people, I work on it to please me. That&#8217;s the beauty of open source. I&#8217;m free to make technology choices unrestricted by legacy or ill-advised customers. If you don&#8217;t &#8220;buy&#8221; Rails, it&#8217;s no skin off my back. There are plenty of people who do buy it because they share the priorities presented.	So if labelling me &#8220;crazy&#8221; helps you ignore the disruptions Rails is bringing to the table, I say go for it. Maybe that&#8217;s an accurate label for me in the current situation you&#8217;re in. And if there&#8217;s no interest or ability to get out of that situation, it&#8217;s probably best to write me and Rails off as crazy such that you can head into work with a smile tomorrow.	Once a high-level component becomes big enough to be interesting, it&#8217;ll take more work to configure it than it would take to build just what you needed from scratch.Should be required reading for anyone interested in Rails." />
