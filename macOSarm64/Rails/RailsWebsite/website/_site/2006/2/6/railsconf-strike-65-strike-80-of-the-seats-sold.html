  <meta name="description" content="RailsConf was announced less than a week ago and the seats are going faster than snappy quick. Of the 400 tickets for sale, 265 were gone as of this morning. That&#8217;s 65% sold or just 135 left.I&#8217;d be very surprised if we still had any tickets left by the end of the week. This is shaping up to be the exclusive event of the year, so if you don&#8217;t want to regret participating in that, you&#8217;d better secure yourself a ticket before it&#8217;s too late.The conference panel is currently judging the more than 80(!) talk proposals and the final schedule will hopefully be announced some times next week.UPDATE: 80% of the tickets are now gone." />
