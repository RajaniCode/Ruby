  <meta name="description" content="RailsConf Europe is imminent. Come next Thursday and hundreds of Rails programmers will descend on London for two days of talks, tricks, and perhaps a pony show.Despite an initially slower opening (compared to the 1 week sell-out madness of the Chicago fair!), RailsConf Europe has indeed managed to sell out the slated 300 seats and then some. All in all, I believe we&#8217;ll almost be pushing 400 people including speakers, staff, and all attendants. That&#8217;s pretty fantastic!I&#8217;m especially pleased to see the final schedule too. Mostly because it looks very little like the Chicago one. We have different headliners like Kathy Sierra and Jim Weirich and the individual sessions are also completely their own. It&#8217;s great that we&#8217;ve been able to fill no less than four tracks with excellent content.So a big thanks and congratulations to all who decided to go. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;re going to have one heck of a show." />
