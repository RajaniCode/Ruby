<p>The Rails javascript helpers has been rewritten in a new gem called <em>rails-ujs</em> and they use vanilla javascript, so jQuery is not a dependency of Rails anymore.</p>

<h3 id="rails-501rc1-has-been-released"><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2016/11/30/Rails-5-0-1-rc1-has-been-released">Rails 5.0.1.rc1 has been released!</a></h3>

<p>The first release candidate for 5.0.1 has been released and if no issues found, the final will be release on the 6th of December.</p>

<p>The <em>form_for</em> and <em>form_tag</em> helpers serve a very similar use-case so they been unified with the new <em>form_with</em> helper.</p>

<h3 id="make-the-second-argument-to-attribute-optional"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/1bdc395d956f789b6612796ac6f130cde90d3066">Make the second argument to attribute optional</a></h3>

<p>A default for the <em>cast_type</em> option of the attribute method has been added to enable calling this method with just the attribute name.</p>

<h3 id="active-record-connections-improvement"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/27108">Active Record connections improvement</a></h3>

<p>Active Record distributed the connection to previously blocked threads on when it cleared the reloadable connections, but with this change the same happens on disconnect too.</p>

<h3 id="use-gen_random_uuid-for-postgresql--94"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/25395">Use gen_random_uuid() for PostgreSQL &gt;= 9.4</a></h3>

<p>With this change, Active Record uses the recommended UUID function depending on the underlying PostgreSQL server’s version, while maintaining uuid_generate_v4() in older migrations.</p>

<h3 id="add-yarn-support-in-new-apps-using-yarn-option-by-liceth--pull-request-26836--railsrails--github"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/26836">Add Yarn support in new apps using –yarn option by Liceth · Pull Request #26836 · rails/rails · GitHub</a></h3>

<p>yarn, the javascript package manager is supported in Rails now! You can pass the –yarn option when you generate a new rails app and Rails will create the necessary config files and run yarn install after bundle install automatically.</p>

<h3 id="introduce-reload_-reader-for-singular-associations"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/27133">Introduce <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reload\_</code> reader for singular associations</a></h3>
