        <p>####</p>

<p>Hey everybody! <a href="https://twitter.com/imtayadeway">Tim</a> here reporting from Portland, OR on another solid week for the Rails community. As a protest to April Fools’ typical tomfoolery, this edition is coming to you 100% jape-free. No, really!</p>

<h2 id="featured">Featured</h2>

<h3 id="this-weeks-rails-contributors"><a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20160326-20160401">This Week’s Rails Contributors</a></h3>

<p>This week 29 lovely people contributed to Rails, including 5 for the first time! A big Friday Hug goes out to all of them! Feel free to check out the list of current <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues">issues</a> for ideas if you’d like to join them ❤️</p>

<h2 id="improved">Improved</h2>

<h3 id="active-record-gets-a-few-extra-query-methods"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/24315">Active Record gets a few extra query methods</a></h3>

<p>Ever find yourself writing cumbersome things like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User.count.zero?</code>? You can now use the terser <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User.none?</code>, as well as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User.one?</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User.empty?</code>, as these three methods just got added.</p>

<h3 id="the-default-worker-pool-size-for-action-cable-just-got-lowered-considerably"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/24376">The default worker pool size for Action Cable just got lowered considerably!</a></h3>

<p>The author of this revision put it best: “Whack it down from 100 to 4”. This will decrease the number of db connections for most, who probably don’t need so many.</p>

<h3 id="notifications-can-now-hook-into-action-cable"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/23723">Notifications can now hook into Action Cable</a></h3>

<p>Just as you can subscribe to Action Controller’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#process_action</code>, so you can now with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ActionCable::Channel::Base#perform_action</code> after this fine addition. Get notified!</p>

<h2 id="fixed">Fixed</h2>

<h3 id="prepared-statements-to-have-a-cache-separate-from-unprepared-statements"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/3af40b71f34c70a274e261cd6e6468c613de648e">Prepared statements to have a cache separate from unprepared statements</a></h3>

<p>This subtle bug was fixed this week, wherein a connection that was established with prepared statements enabled could fail if a query that had been previously run was run again with prepared statements disabled. This was because it was hitting the same cache as the prepared statements-enabled query. Prepared statements now have their own cache, which solves the problem. Hurrah!</p>

<h3 id="rails-runner-now-shows-the-correct-command-name-when-run-with-spring"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/24325">rails runner now shows the correct command name when run with Spring</a></h3>

<p>Running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rails runner</code> with no arguments or with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--help</code> flag shows you some information on how to use the runner as a shebang line. Unfortunately, if you were using Spring, it would get the path wrong because Spring changes a variable that relates to the command that was run (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin/rails</code>). That just got fixed in this revision!</p>

<h3 id="using-rails-restart-with-puma-now-works"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/24331">Using rails restart with Puma now works!</a></h3>

<p>Previously, when issuing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rails restart</code> with Puma running, it would fail to bring it up again since Puma was trying to inspect <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ARGV</code> to decide how to go about it. The fix involved changing Puma to allow its configuration options to be overridden by Rails. Great job!</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>That’s all for This week in Rails. As always, there are plenty of things we’re not able to cover here, so take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/master@%7B2016-03-26%7D...@%7B2016-04-01%7D">changes</a> yourself.</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>
