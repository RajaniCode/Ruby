We&#8217;ve also been working to update the Guides for Rails 2.3, as well as to add new guides to the list.And there&#8217;s good news if you want to get involved too. Behind the scenes, Tore and Pratik switched our markup engine from AsciiDoc to Textile. This makes the Guides easier to write and edit and easier to build into a Rails project. If you&#8217;ve got some spare time to help out, join us in the #docrails room on irc.freenode.net, and help make the Rails Guides into a great resource in time for the 2.3 release." />
