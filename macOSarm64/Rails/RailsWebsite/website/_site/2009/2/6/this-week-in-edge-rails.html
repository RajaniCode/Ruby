<h2>Nested Form Support in Active Record and Action Pack</h2>
<p>This one is big enough that it got a whole <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2009/1/26/nested-model-forms">blog entry</a> of its own (the version that was committed has minor changes from what you&#8217;ll see there). There are two main parts to this commit. First, Active Record can now update the attributes on nested models directly, provided you tell it to do so:</p>
<pre><code>
class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :author
  has_many :pages

  accepts_nested_attributes_for :author, :pages
end
</code></pre>
<p>Turning on nested attributes enables a number of things, including automatic (and atomic) saving of a record together with its associated children, and child-aware validations. But the big visible one is nested form support. Provided the parent model accepts nested attributes for the child objects, you can create nested forms using <code>form_for</code> and <code>field_for</code>. These forms can be nested arbitrarily deep, allowing you to edit complex object hierarchies on a single view without excessive code. For example, given this model:</p>
<pre><code>
class Customer &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :orders

  accepts_nested_attributes_for :orders, 
    :allow_destroy =&gt; true
end
</code></pre>
<p>You can write this view in Rails 2.3:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;% form_for @customer do |customer_form| %&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;%= customer_form.label :name, 'Customer Name:' %&gt;
    &lt;%= customer_form.text_field :name %&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;!-- Here we call fields_for on the customer_form builder instance.
   The block is called for each member of the orders collection. --&gt;
  &lt;% customer_form.fields_for :orders do |order_form| %&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;%= order_form.label :number, 'Order Number:' %&gt;
        &lt;%= order_form.text_field :number %&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;!-- The allow_destroy option in the model enables deletion of
   child records. --&gt;
      &lt;% unless order_form.object.new_record? %&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;%= order_form.label :_delete, 'Remove:' %&gt;
          &lt;%= order_form.check_box :_delete %&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;% end %&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;

  &lt;%= customer_form.submit %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Rails Guides Rework</h2>
<p>The Rails Guides have switched from using AsciiDoc markup to using Textile markup. This has a couple of benefits: first, it makes it easier to contribute to a guide. Second, it means that we can dispense with the compiled <span class="caps">HTML</span> versions of the guides in the Rails tree, because we can assume any developer can build from Textile. There&#8217;s a spiffy new look for the Guides web site too &#8211; check it out at the <a href="http://guides.rails.info">beta site</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/96d610553e5fdaabc923835ab1f194070ddb4477">commit</a></p>
<h2>Scaffolding Changes</h2>
<p>There were some cleanups to the code produced by <code>script/generate scaffold</code> &#8211; nothing too major, but they bring the controller and views more into line with current Rails best practices. Along the same lines, the &#8220;Riding the Rails&#8221; index.html page generated in new Rails applications now includes a link to the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org">Rails Guides</a>.</p>
