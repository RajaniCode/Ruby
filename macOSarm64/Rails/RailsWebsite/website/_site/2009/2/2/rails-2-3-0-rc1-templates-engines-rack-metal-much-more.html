So we need solid testing and will probably have a slightly longer than average release candidate phase to account for that.But boy will it be worth it. This is one of the most substantial upgrades to Rails in a very long time. A brief rundown of the top hitters:	Templates: Allows your new skeleton Rails application to be built your way with your default stack of gems, configs, and more.	Engines: Share reusable application pieces complete with routes that Just Work, models, view paths, and the works.	Rack: Rails now runs on Rack which gives you access to all the middleware goodness.	Metal: Write super fast pieces of optimized logic that routes around Action Controller.	Nested forms: Deal with complex forms so much easier.And that&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg. We&#8217;ve put together a complete guide for the Rails 2.3 release notes with much more information.You can install the release candidate with:gem install rails --source http://gems.rubyonrails.orgEnjoy, report the bugs, and let&#8217;s get Rails 2.3 final out the door soon." />
