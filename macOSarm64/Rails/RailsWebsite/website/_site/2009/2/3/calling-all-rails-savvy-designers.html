  <meta name="description" content="One thing that has been a continuing challenge for many Rails developers is finding a good designer to work with. There are certainly plenty of fantastic designers out there, but it&#8217;s often difficult to find one who is comfortable working directly in a Rails project.In an effort to help ease this challenge, and at the behest of some interested developers and designers, the Rails Activists have set up a group for Ruby Graphics Designers. The idea is to have a place for communication: a spot where designers can ask questions about git or erb, or where developers can try to find a designer to work with.Of course, a group without participation is nothing to crow about. If you&#8217;re a developer &#8211; or especially if you&#8217;re a designer who works with Rails &#8211; we&#8217;d love to have your participation. If you&#8217;re interested in the visual design and information architecture of Rails applications, c&#8217;mon by and say hi! And if you have other ideas about how we can encourage closer collaboration between the Rails community and the design community, we&#8217;d love to hear them." />
