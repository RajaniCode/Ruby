<h2>Update</h2>
<p>Since I initially wrote up this post, there have been several more events I&#8217;ve been made aware of (from the comments):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://barcamp.org/RubyCampLyon" title="RubyCamp Lyon">RubyCamp Lyon</a>, France, February 21, Cost: Free</li>
<li><a href="http://rubyonosx.com/" title="Ruby on OS X">Ruby on OS X</a>, Amsterdam, May 15-16, Cost: ?.</li>
<li><a href="http://rubydcamp.org" title="Ruby DCamp">Ruby DCamp</a> Washington DC, September 18-19, Cost: Free</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty cool to see more RubyCamps.  I&#8217;m a big fan of BarCamp type events where you keep admission free.  Perhaps in this financial climate these types of events will prosper more then they normally do.  Feel free to bug me if you want help putting one of these together or need help with publicity.</p>
