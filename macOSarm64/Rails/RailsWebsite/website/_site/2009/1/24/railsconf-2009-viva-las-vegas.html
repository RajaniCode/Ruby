  <meta name="description" content="RailsConf 2009 is now open for registration. We&#8217;re going to Las Vegas this year. More precisely the Las Vegas Hilton from May 4th through 7th. It&#8217;s going to be a party for sure.There has been such an incredible amount of activity since last year. We have the merging of Merb back into Rails, Rails 2.2 and 2.3, and probably a good showing of Rails 3.0. So we should be absolutely packed for great content this year.It&#8217;s going to be hard to top 2008, though. I really thought that was a fantastic show. Great lineup of proposals, great speakers, and a great sense of community. Which is pretty hard to do when you have almost 2,000 people gathered. So we&#8217;ll try extra hard this year to outdo it.So I hope to see many familiar and new faces this year. We have early registration open until March 16th, so you can save up to $200 by getting it done early.Don&#8217;t forget to get your speaker proposal in either. You have until February 17th.See you all in Vegas!" />
