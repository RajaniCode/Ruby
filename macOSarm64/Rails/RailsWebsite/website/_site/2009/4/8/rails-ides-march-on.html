  <meta name="description" content="Many Rails developers are perfectly happy working on their code in a text editor &#8211; and there are certainly plenty of excellent text editors out there. But others, particularly those who have come to Rails from another platform, find themselves wanting a full integrated development environment. For the latter group of developers, there&#8217;s good news: two major cross-platform Rails IDEs have releases available now.Aptana&#8217;s RadRails (a plugin for their Aptana Studio IDE) has just released version 1.2. This Eclipse-based environment will seem instantly familiar to many users, and version 1.2 has a couple of major advances to boast about. First, it includes a wizard that will aid new users in setting up Ruby, Gems, and Rails; this is likely to be especially useful to those coming to Rails on Windows. Second, it has built-in deployment to Aptana&#8217;s Cloud Connect scalable deployment service, giving a pain-free way to get your Rails applications up and running.Also worth a look is JetBrains&#8217; RubyMine, currently in late beta prior to its commercial release. A purpose-built Rails IDE, it offers a variety of features including rake support, a model diagrammer, built-in web previews, and code quality tools. RubyMine isn&#8217;t finished yet, but the current beta version is showing good promise.Both RadRails and RubyMine have the features you&#8217;d expect from an IDE, including flexible code editors, refactoring support, built-in hooks for test running, integrated debugging, and source code integration. RadRails comes in both community and $99 Pro editions, while RubyMine is scheduled to be released at $99. Whether you prefer to work in a text editor or an IDE, the appearance of these applications is yet another sign of the continuing popularity and growth of the Rails ecosystem." />
