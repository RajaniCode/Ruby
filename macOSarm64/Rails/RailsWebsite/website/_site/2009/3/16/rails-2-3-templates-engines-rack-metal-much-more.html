  <meta name="description" content="Rails 2.3 is finally done and out the door. This is one of the most substantial upgrades to Rails in a very long time. A brief rundown of the top hitters:	Templates: Allows your new skeleton Rails application to be built your way with your default stack of gems, configs, and more.	Engines: Share reusable application pieces complete with routes that Just Work, models, view paths, and the works.	Rack: Rails now runs on Rack which gives you access to all the middleware goodness.	Metal: Write super fast pieces of optimized logic that routes around Action Controller.	Nested forms: Deal with complex forms so much easier.And that&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg. We&#8217;ve put together a complete guide for the Rails 2.3 release notes with much more information. Be sure to checkout the section on what was deprecated when you&#8217;re ready to upgrade your application.You install 2.3 with (the final version is marked 2.3.2):gem install railsIf you&#8217;re running on Passenger, be sure to upgrade to 2.1.2 as well. Rails 2.3 doesn&#8217;t run on older versions of Passenger!We hope you&#8217;ll love it." />
