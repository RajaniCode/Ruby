        <p>Happy new year everyone! The Rails Foundation is kicking off the year with great news: <a href="https://www.saeloun.com/">Saeloun</a> has joined the Rails Foundation as its newest Contributing member!</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px"><img src="/assets/images/logo-saeloun-2.svg" style="width: 50%" /></p>

<p>Saeloun is a Ruby on Rails consulting agency, based out of Boston, MA, and Pune, India. The team helps lead and grow startups and large corporations such as HaulHub and Methodology, helping with full stack Rails development, Rails upgrades, maintenance, scaling and performance, and helping companies implement AI solutions with their Rails apps.</p>

<p>Saeloun is joining the Rails Foundation after years of actively making contributions to both the framework and the community.</p>

<p>In fact, you might recognize two Saeloun names - CEO <a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/vipul-a-m/commits">Vipul A M</a>, and Lead Software Developer <a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/akhil-g-krishnan/commits">Akhil G Krishnan</a> - from the Rails Issues team, where they help the Core and Committer teams triage issues. Both are also in the top 85 <a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/">contributors</a> to the Rails framework, along with other Saeloun engineers on the full list.</p>

<p>Saeloun helps run the Pune Ruby Meetup, React Pune Meetup, and they sponsor numerous <a href="https://www.saeloun.com/ruby-on-rails-community#open_source">Ruby events and conferences</a> including Rails Girls, Ruby Conf India and Rails World 2025.</p>

<p>They also help document the latest Rails and Ruby features and updates on both the <a href="https://blog.saeloun.com/category/rails/">Saeloun blog</a> and the <a href="https://world.hey.com/this.week.in.rails">This Week in Rails newsletter</a>, where Vipul is a regular contributor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While working with the Rails Newsletter team and Rails Docs/Triage team, I get a front row seat to see the amount of work that the Foundation has done and keeps shipping every day!
I have worked or have been contributing to the Rails ecosystem for more than a decade. But these last two years, I can clearly see the immense effects the Foundation has had in pushing Rails, with the documentation, marketing, and various events it hosts. Growth of Rails as a framework and its community helps Saeloun greatly, and being part of the Foundation helps us be part of this growth in a small way. We have for the past decade and will continue to be ALL-IN with Rails!
<br /><br /><em>Vipul A M, Saeloun CEO</em></p>
