The Rails World conference app is developed by Telos Labs. Attendees can see a more detailed agenda, build their schedule, receive notifications of upcoming sessions, and share their profile for networking. Telos Labs has <a href="https://www.teloslabs.co/post/rails-world-2024-conference-app">open sourced this app</a>, and it is our hope that the (many) events in our space will also use it for their own events.</p>

<p>Most foreign nationals need a temporary resident visa (TRV) or an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) to travel to Canada.</p>

<p>ETAs are easy and take minutes to request, however if you need a TRV, the process can be considerably longer. Registered attendees have received information about visas and requesting a letter of invitation in their ticket confirmation.</p>

please let us know as soon as possible by emailing <a href="mailto:world@rubyonrails.org">world@rubyonrails.org</a>.</p>

<p>Full refunds are available up to 45 days prior to the start of the
event, minus a 4% transaction fee. If you cancel between 44 and 30 days
prior to the event, you are eligible for a 50% refund, minus the
transaction fee.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we cannot provide any
refunds for cancellations less than 30 days prior to the event.
However, you may transfer your ticket to another attendee free of charge
up to 14 days prior to the start of Rails World.</p>

<p>Badges will be pre-printed 14 days before the event, so no changes or transfers will be honored after that date.</p>

                            <p>As of now (April 2024), Canada does not require testing, proof of vaccination, or masks at events, and so they will not be required for Rails World. Any changes in this policy will be communicated to attendees as soon as they are known.</p>

<p>Those who feel more comfortable wearing masks are always welcome to do so, and we do ask that you abide by the new golden rule: if you feel unwell on the day of the event or the days leading up to the event, please do not come.</p>

<p>In the event you test positive for Covid immediately before or on the first day of Rails World, your ticket cost will be transferred into credit to be used at the next Rails World event. To request credit for your attendance fee, or if you have any questions, please contact <a href="mailto:world@rubyonrails.org">world@rubyonrails.org</a>.</p>
