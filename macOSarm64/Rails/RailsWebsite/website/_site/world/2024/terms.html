        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1> 
        <h2 id="registration-and-attendance">Registration and Attendance:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>To attend our events, please make sure to register in advance through our official registration process. We won’t be selling tickets at the door, so don’t forget to register early!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We kindly ask that attendees do not bring non-registered individuals to Rails World. If you’d like to bring guests, please make sure they each register and purchase their own separate ticket for Rails World.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At Rails Foundation, we welcome everyone, but we do reserve the right to refuse or revoke attendance to any person or organization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To ensure everyone has a pleasant and enjoyable experience at Rails World, please refrain from soliciting or selling products or services unless you have received prior
written approval from the Rails Foundation. Any attendee conducting such activities may be asked to leave the event at our discretion, and refunds will not be provided.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please make sure to wear your event badge at all times during our in-person events, and keep it visible to other attendees and participants. Remember not to share or exchange your event badge with anyone else.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct:</h2>

<p>Rails, the Rails Foundation, and Rails World organizers are committed to fostering a welcoming community. We abide by, and expect all community members both online and in person to abide by the Rails Code of Conduct found <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/conduct">here</a>.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to remove any attendee from the event for violating the Code of Conduct, without refund or compensation.</p>

<p>Please report any instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior to conference organizers on-site, or by emailing <a href="mailto:info@rubyonrails.org">info@rubyonrails.org</a> and we will do our best to respond immediately.</p>

<h2 id="content-ownership">Content Ownership:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We respect the intellectual property of our presenters and their employers. All content presented at Rails World belongs to the presenter and/or their employer, and Rails Foundation will not claim ownership over any of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We would love to promote the great work of our presenters! By presenting at Rails World, presenters agree to let Rails Foundation record, distribute, and use their presentation for promotional purposes. However, we understand that not everyone wants their presentation displayed on our websites or social media, so speakers can let us know their preferences during the speaker fulfillment process. We’ll make sure to respect those wishes.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="changes-and-cancellations-to-the-event">Changes and Cancellations to the Event:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Rails Foundation reserves the right to make changes to the event schedule or programming at any time, without prior notice, but we’ll do our best to let you know as soon as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the event of cancellation due to circumstances beyond Rails Foundation’s control, Rails World will be rescheduled to a later date. Attendees will be entitled to reschedule their registration for the new event date without any liability or additional charges.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rails Foundation is not responsible for any expenses incurred by attendees as a result of event changes or cancellations.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="cancellations-and-refunds">Cancellations and Refunds:</h2>

<p>If you need to cancel your registration for Rails World, please let us know as soon as possible by emailing <a href="mailto:world@rubyonrails.org">world@rubyonrails.org</a>.</p>

<p>Full refunds are available up to 45 days prior to the start of the event, minus a 4% transaction fee.
If you cancel between 44 and 30 days prior to the event, you are eligible for a 50% refund, minus the transaction fee.
Unfortunately, we cannot provide any refunds for cancellations less than 30 days prior to the event. However, you may transfer your ticket to another attendee free of charge up to 14 days prior to the start of Rails World.</p>

<h2 id="covid-related-policies">Covid-related policies:</h2>

<p>Rails World will abide by local health and safety laws/regulations that are in place, including any in place at the time for COVID-19, at the time of the event and will require that all attendees comply. Any changes to local government laws/regulations will be issued closer to the event.</p>

<p>In the event you test positive for Covid immediately before or on the first day of Rails World, your ticket cost will be transferred into credit to be used at the next Rails World event. To request credit for your attendance fee, please contact <a href="mailto:info@rubyonrails.org">info@rubyonrails.org</a>.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: These policies may be subject to change as application laws and regulations may change. The Rails World organizers will strive to inform attendees immediately of any changes.</p>

<h2 id="photography-and-recording">Photography and Recording:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Rails Foundation reserves the right to record, photograph, or livestream Rails World for promotional purposes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By registering for Rails World, you grant the Rails Foundation permission to use your likeness in any photograph, video, or digital media for any lawful purpose. You waive any right to royalties or other compensation arising from the use of your likeness. You release the Rails Foundation from any claims related to this use of your likeness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attendees who do not wish to have their photograph taken or used by the Rails Foundation are requested to inform our staff at the registration desk or in the registration process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attendees may not record, photograph, or livestream Rails World sessions without prior permission from Rails Foundation and the presenter.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="privacy">Privacy:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Rails Foundation is committed to protecting the privacy of its attendees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attendees’ personal information will only be used for event-related communications and will not be shared with third parties except as described in our Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2 id="governing-law">Governing Law:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and of the United States, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions.</p>

<h2 id="indemnification">Indemnification:</h2>

<p>You will indemnify, defend and hold the Rails Foundations, its affiliates and licensors, and each of their respective employees, officers, directors, agents and representatives, harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, penalties, fines, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), whether commenced or threatened arising out of or related to: (a) your negligence or willful misconduct or any violation by you of this Agreement, or (b) your injury to persons or property.</p>

<h2 id="liability">Liability:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Rails Foundation is not responsible for any injury, loss, or damage to attendees or their property during the event, unless caused by the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of the Rails Foundation or its agents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attendees must comply with all local laws and regulations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Rails Foundation will not be liable for any acts of God, fires, strikes, accidents, or other occurrences beyond its control (whether like or unlike those enumerated herein) that prevent the Rails Foundation from partially or completely performing its obligations hereunder. Provided, however, that if Rails World’s location is affected by (1) new city, county, state, or federal mandates that require updated social distancing guidelines for social events and modified setups or if Rails World cannot accommodate some of the contracted number of attendees for each setup(s) to ensure compliance or (2) new city, county, state, federal or transportation-related mandates that make it impossible or illegal for some attendees to attend, the Rails Foundation will refund attendance fees to affected attendees. The Rails Foundation shall not be liable for any consequential damages that may result from events contemplated in this section.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="disclaimers">Disclaimers:</h2>

<p>The Rails Foundation provides no warranties, express or implied, for any goods or services provided or any component or part thereof. Your attendance at Rails World is voluntary, and you accept and assume all risks of personal injury or damage to personal property. You waive any claims against the Rails Foundation and/or its affiliates, sponsors or vendors for such risks. The Rails Foundation reserves the right to limit attendees, cancel registrations, bar individuals from attending, and refuse access to materials.</p>

<p>By attending Rails World, attendees agree to these terms and conditions. Rails Foundation reserves the right to make changes to these terms and conditions at any time, without prior notice.</p>
