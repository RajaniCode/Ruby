        <p>The Rails Foundation has partnered with <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/">Le Wagon</a> to search for two outstanding emcees to host our <a href="/world">Rails World</a> stages in Amsterdam this October. The roles will be filled with recent graduates of the Le Wagon Web Development course, because what better way for a junior developer to kickstart their career in Rails than by sharing the stage with our industry’s best speakers?</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px"><a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" target="new"><img src="/assets/images/logo-lewagon.svg" style="width: 50%" /></a></p>

<p>Since 2013, Le Wagon has taught Rails to more than 22,000 new developers (often career changers) at their immersive coding bootcamps across Europe, the Americas, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and online, and has seen more than 200 startups launch from their alumni community.</p>

<p>Le Wagon’s commitment to teaching Rails has been crucial in nurturing the next generation of Rails enthusiasts, so they were a natural for this partnership.</p>

<p>As the face of Rails World, an emcee’s role will be to host a stage, introduce speakers to the audience, share relevant event updates, and keep the energy level high throughout the event.</p>

<p>This is a great opportunity for a junior Rails developer just getting started in their career and looking to get involved in the community, and it wouldn’t be possible without the enthusiasm and support of everyone at Le Wagon.</p>

<p><strong>Now, the search for our emcees begins</strong>. Le Wagon alumni who have graduated in the past year are invited to apply- details shared in the Le Wagon alumni internal Slack.</p>

<p>Good luck to all who apply! We can’t wait to see you on stage at Rails World.</p>
