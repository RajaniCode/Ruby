        <p>Saluton! That’s Esperanto for “Hello!” 😜… <a href="https://hayford.dev/">Emmanuel Hayford</a> here, let’s see what’s new in Rails as we gear up for <strong>Composite Primary Keys (CPKs)</strong> support.</p>

<p>But first, here’s a fine opportunity for junior Ruby on Rails developers: As part of <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2023/4/13/attention-junior-devs-want-to-build-the-rails-world-website">preparations for the upcoming Rails World conference in Amsterdam, Netherlands</a> this year, The Rails Foundation is presenting an opportunity to junior Ruby on Rails developers. Paired with a mentor, the goal is for the junior developer to build a website to host the event!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47928">Support deleting records from associations for CPK</a>
This PR improves the behaviour around deleting records from associations in composite contexts. Previously, an <em>ArgumentError</em> would raise if one attempted to delete records from associations in composite contexts.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47925">Ensure that ids_writer and ids_reader are working for CPK</a>
The latest update to <em>ids_writer</em> addresses an issue with handling composite primary keys. Previously, the writer was able to handle a CPK model associated with a non-CPK model without any errors. However, when it came to a CPK model associated with another CPK model, the writer produced incorrect IDs. This PR fixes the issue.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47901">Support batching using composite primary keys</a>
Batching was previously limited to tables with simple primary keys, but it can now be used with tables that have composite primary keys.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47899">Rewrite Asset Pipeline guide for Rails 7</a>
This PR was created to update the asset pipeline guide, which had become outdated in several ways. It didn’t mention some important updates, such as the <strong>importmaps-rails</strong> gem that is now the default solution for JavaScript.</p>

<p>This update is one that’s long due.</p>

<p>The guide on Sprockets was also outdated as it was written before Sprockets 4.0, which introduced the <em>manifest.js</em> file, and some of its parts were no longer relevant. Furthermore, the guide failed to mention several useful gems, including <strong>jsbundling-rails</strong> , <strong>cssbundling-rails</strong> , <strong>dartsass-rails</strong> , and <strong>tailwindcss-rails</strong>.</p>

<p>This PR aims to bring the guide up-to-date with the latest changes in Rails and highlight the best practices for managing assets.</p>

<p>We had  <a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20230407-20230414">29 contributors</a> in the last seven days.</p>

<p>See you next week!</p>
