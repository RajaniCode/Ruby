        <p>We are happy to give a warm welcome to <a href="https://www.renuo.ch/">Renuo</a>, the latest Contributing member to join the Rails Foundation.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px"><img src="/assets/images/logo-renuo.svg" style="width: 50%" /></p>

<p>Renuo is a web agency based in Zurich, Switzerland, that has worked with Ruby on Rails since its foundation in 2011, focusing mostly on the Swiss market. They are the first Swiss company to join the Rails Foundation, and we are excited to have them!</p>

<p>With solid roots in open source, Renuo has a company culture focused on giving back to the open-source community. They support events such as the Railshöck meetup in Zürich and <a href="https://helvetic-ruby.ch/">Helvetic Ruby</a>, and several Renuo employees teach at Le Wagon’s coding bootcamp. They also donate 10% of their annual profit to charities and open-source projects, all of which the company decides on together.</p>

<p>In addition to the financial support of <a href="https://github.com/orgs/renuo/sponsoring">numerous projects</a> each year, Renuo also maintains well-known libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan">cancancan</a>. A lot of their <a href="https://github.com/renuo">own work</a>, their <a href="https://www.renuo.ch/blog/the-renuo-flow-or-our-definition-of-done">internal workflow</a>, and their <a href="https://github.com/renuo/applications-setup-guide">Applications Setup Guide</a> are also open-sourced.</p>

<p>This commitment to open source is also what inspired them to become a member of the Rails Foundation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We want to contribute to the longevity of Rails. Every day, a new project is bootstrapped using Ruby On Rails, and we’d like to provide a more basic angle to the future development of Rails. We come from a small agency’s point of view and want to influence the formal and cultural groundwork as a small player.</p>

  <p>We also feel strongly about education. Our vision? To see Ruby on Rails in universities.
<br /><br /><em>Alessandro Rodi, Software Engineer &amp; Partner</em></p>

</blockquote>

<p>For these reasons and more, we are excited to work with Renuo. With solid ideals, a deep appreciation for open source, and a desire to see Rails continue to flourish, they are a perfect addition to the foundation, and we look forward to their input on the foundation’s mission moving forward.</p>
