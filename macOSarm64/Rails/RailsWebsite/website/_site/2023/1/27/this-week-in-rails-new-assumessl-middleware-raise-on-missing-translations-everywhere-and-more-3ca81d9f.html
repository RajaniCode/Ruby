        <p>Hi, it’s <a href="https://twitter.com/morgoth85">Wojtek</a>. Let’s explore this week’s changes in the Rails codebase.</p>

<p><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2023/1/24/Rails-7-0-4-2-and-6-1-7-2-have-been-released"><strong>Rails 7.0.4.2 and 6.1.7.2 have been released</strong></a><br />
Released 7.0.4.2 and 6.1.7.2 versions addressing a compatibility issue with the 7.0.4.1 and 6.1.7.1 security releases from last week.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47139"><strong>Allow use of SSL-terminating reserve proxy that doesn’t set headers</strong></a><br />
Add <em>ActionDispatch::AssumeSSL</em> middleware that can be turned on via <em>config.assume_ssl</em>. It makes the application believe that all requests are arriving over <em>SSL</em>. This is useful when proxying through a load balancer that terminates <em>SSL</em>, the forwarded request will appear as though it’s <em>HTTP</em> instead of <em>HTTPS</em> to the application. This makes redirects and cookie security target <em>HTTP</em> instead of <em>HTTPS</em>. This middleware makes the server assume that the proxy already terminated <em>SSL</em>, and that the request really is <em>HTTPS</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47143"><strong>Control log level with RAILS_LOG_LEVEL in production</strong></a></p>

<p>Makes it easier to switch to debug mode when needed without changing the code.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47105"><strong>Make raise_on_missing_translations raise on any missing translation</strong></a></p>

<p>Previously it would only raise when called in a view or controller. Now it will raise anytime <em>I18n.t</em> is provided with an unrecognized key.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47043"><strong>Active Record’s explain method now accepts options</strong></a><br />
For databases and adapters which support them (currently <em>PostgreSQL</em> and <em>MySQL</em>), options can be passed to <em>explain</em> to provide more a detailed query plan analysis.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46447"><strong>Update Action Text’s Trix dependency</strong></a><br />
The bundled version of Trix was updated from version 1.3 to <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/trix/releases/tag/v2.0.0">version 2.0</a>.</p>
