        <p>Hi! <a href="https://twitter.com/siaw23">Emmanuel</a> here writing from a train to Katowice! There have been quite a few developments in the Rails codebase over the last few weeks! Let’s take a look at some of them, shall we?</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/48407">Create a class level #with_routing helper</a>
The <em>with_routing</em> helper can now be called at the class level. When called at this level, the routes will be set up before each test and reset after every test. For example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class RoutingTest &lt; ActionController::TestCase
      with_routing do |routes|
        routes.draw do
          resources :articles
          resources :authors
        end
      end
      def test_articles_route
        assert_routing("/articles", controller: "articles", action: "index")
      end
       def test_authors_route
        assert_routing("/authors", controller: "authors", action: "index")
      end
    end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47633">Allow composite primary key to be derived from schema</a>
When launching an application with a schema that incorporates composite primary keys, there will no longer be a warning issued, and the <em>ActiveRecord::Base#primary_key</em> value will not be set to <em>nil</em> anymore.</p>

<p>For instance, consider a table named <em>travel_routes</em> and a corresponding <em>TravelRoute</em> model. In this case, the <em>TravelRoute.primary_key</em> value will be automatically derived as <em>[“origin”, “destination”]</em>, as demonstrated in the following example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>create_table :travel_routes, primary_key: [:origin, :destination], force: true do |t|
     t.string :origin
     t.string :destination
   end
   class TravelRoute &lt; ActiveRecord::Base; end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/48295">Store connection_pool in database-related exceptions</a>
When exceptions are raised from an adapter, it is beneficial to include the <em>connection_pool</em> as it offers additional context. This context includes information about the connection that triggered the exception, as well as details regarding the role and shard involved.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/48388">Add engine draw_paths to app</a>
By adding the engine’s draw paths to the application route set, the application gains the capability to access and utilize route files defined within engine paths.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/48397">Improve quoted parameters in mime types</a>
The <em>Mime::Type</em> now offers support for handling types with parameters, ensuring proper handling of quotes. During the parsing of the accept header, the parameters preceding the ‘q’ parameter are retained, and if a matching mime-type is found, it is utilized accordingly. To maintain the existing functionality, a fallback mechanism has been implemented to search for the media-type without the parameters.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/48268">Support batching using composite primary keys and multiple column ordering</a>
The <em>find_each</em>, <em>find_in_batches</em>, and <em>in_batches</em> methods now offer support for multiple column ordering. When these methods are used on a table with composite primary keys, it is possible to specify ascending or descending order for each individual key. Example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Person.find_each(order: [:desc, :asc]) do |person|
      person.party_all_night!
    end
</code></pre></div></div>
