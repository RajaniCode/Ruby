        <p>We are pleased to announce the <a href="https://www.papercall.io/rails-world-2023">Call for Papers (CFP) for Rails World 2023</a>.</p>

<p>Rails World is the first conference hosted by the Rails Foundation, and coincides with the 20th anniversary of the Ruby on Rails framework. It will take place on October 5 &amp; 6, 2023 in the Beurs van Berlage in Amsterdam, Netherlands.</p>

<p>There is space in the agenda for 26 talks on two tracks, and up to six workshops. Talks will be recorded for later publishing on the Rails YouTube channel and event website, and we are currently exploring the idea of a livestream during the event. This first edition will welcome 650 attendees.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.papercall.io/rails-world-2023">Submit your proposal here.</a></p>

<p>This CFP is open until June 16, and we are aiming to inform all applicants if they are accepted (or not) before tickets are released.</p>

<p><strong>So: what kind of talks are we looking for?</strong></p>

<p>Ruby on Rails has been a foundational technology for many developers for over 20 years, and is today stronger than ever thanks to continued progress in both core frameworks, like Active Record and Action Mailbox, as well as associated tools and frameworks, like Hotwire, Kredis, and MRSK.</p>

<p>Therefore, we are particularly interested in hearing talks that explore emerging trends and innovative approaches to building applications with Rails. We want to hear about ideas that are forward-thinking, yet practical. Now and in the future, how does Rails make hard tasks possible, easy, trivial, or even delightful, promoting developer happiness and productivity?</p>

<p>Other suggestions could cover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your journey ‘From Hello World to IPO’: Rails as the <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-one-person-framework-711e6318">One Person Framework</a>, Rails at scale, or somewhere in between</li>
  <li>The competitive advantage of Rails – real world examples of the speed of execution of developing a full-stack Rails app vs the SPA approach</li>
  <li>The state of Rails and its ecosystem, including emerging technologies and trends</li>
  <li>Case studies of successful Rails projects and the challenges you faced</li>
  <li>Using Rails to build applications for emerging technologies such as blockchain and AI</li>
  <li>The future of Rails and its role in the broader tech industry, including potential areas for growth and innovation</li>
  <li>Best practices for Rails development, including testing, deployment, and performance optimization, and the pros and cons of various hosting options</li>
  <li>Ways you use Rails which reinforce the elements of the Rails doctrine</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether you’re a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the Rails ecosystem, we encourage you to submit proposals that challenge the status quo, showcase forward-thinking ideas and visionary insights, and push the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>

<p>Let’s shape the future of Rails and build a stronger, more vibrant community for generations to come.</p>

<p>Stay tuned. More information coming in:</p>
