It is ideal for system administration, and for deploying web applications.Note, though, that this release is not entirely backwards compatible with Capistrano 1.x, so you may need to massage your recipes a little to make them work smoothly under the new version. In order to make the upgrade process as smooth as possible, I&#8217;ve begun compiling a few documents to point out new features, gotchas, and upgrade paths:http://www.capify.org/upgradeLike Capistrano 2.0, the new www.capify.org website is still a bit rough in spots, and will see more documentation appearing over the next few weeks.
