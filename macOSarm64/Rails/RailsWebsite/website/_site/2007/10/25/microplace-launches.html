Josh Susser, one of the contractors that worked on it, wrote a great introduction to the project.&#8220;As far as I am aware, MicroPlace is the first SEC-registered online brokerage implemented in Ruby on Rails. We had to go through an extensive security audit, and there were a lot of regulatory requirements for us to meet&#8230; But the bottom line is that we didn&#8217;t have any significant problems with either Ruby or Rails in passing those hurdles.&#8221;Josh also mentioned that MicroPlace is owned by eBay, making this the first Rails project at an otherwise all-Java shop.  Awesome, high-fives all around guys.  I hope to see more posts about the development aspect of the site." />
