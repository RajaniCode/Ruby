        <p>Earlier this week, Hunter, uber technocrat at <a href="http://www.dailykos.com">DailyKos.com</a> started talking about how they will build the next version of DailyKos. The <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/1/3/182756/0971">discussion</a> has been going for a day or two now with over 700 comments as I write this.</p>

<p>While DailyKos is the highest-traffic political blog in the US, I don’t think it’s particularly newsworthy that they are considering Rails. In fact, I think it’s quite the opposite. What I do find interesting is the evolving discussion about the choices. Hunter essentially set out Perl/mod_perl, Python/Django and Ruby/Rails as the main choices. What people have to say about the differences and why they would choose one over the others makes for some really I-should-have-been-in-bed-an-hour-ago reading. Some of what people think they know about Ruby and Rails seems to be out of date or otherwise misinformed, but there are some good arguments on all sides.</p>

<p>If you are gearing up to have a conversation with management about picking Rails for a big project, take a read to see in one place all the arguments you will have to deal with!</p>
