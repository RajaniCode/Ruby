  <meta name="description" content="RailsConf has sold close to three quarters of the available seats for the May 17-20 show at an amazing rate. It&#8217;s only been a week since we opened for registrations. So it&#8217;s naturally wonderful to see that level of excitement even as our venue this year can accommodate a ton more people than last year. This certainly looks like it&#8217;ll be another sold out RailsConf shortly.And hot on the heels of RailsConf in Portland, we&#8217;ve just opened up the Request for Proposals for RailsConf Europe, which will take place in Berlin between September 17-19. Last year RailsConf EU was a bit more of a sleeper hit than the Chicago show, but turned out absolutely fantastic with loads of exclusive and all-new content. With Berlin being a significantly cheaper city than London and part of mainland Europe, we&#8217;ll no doubt have an even greater show.So get your proposals ready for RailsConf Europe. And if you haven&#8217;t already, snatch one of the last seats for RailsConf in Portland." />
