Luckily, it happens to ship with Tiger.  &#8220;java -version&#8221; tells me I have v1.5.0_06.  Awesome.	I actually set this up over the weekend, and used &#8216;ant test&#8217; to build and test JRuby.  This required me to install JUnit to proceed.  I just created a directory to act as my CLASSPATH, and threw junit-4.1.jar in there.	Set up a few environment variables (see below for the list).	Add /path/to/jruby/bin to your PATH.export CLASSPATH=/path/to/junit-4.1.jarexport JRUBY_HOME=/path/to/jrubyexport JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Homeexport JRUBY_SHELL=/bin/zshAfter this was done, I was able to run jruby or jirb directly.  Depending on where you add the jruby/bin path, you may or may not be using the JRuby gem script or not.  Use &#8216;which gem&#8217; to check.There you go, you should be all ready to help the JRuby folks out." />
