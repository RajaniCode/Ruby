Last year the 600 seats were gone in a week and change.We&#8217;ve doubled capacity this year, but the growth of Rails has shot up even faster than that. So if you want to be sure not to miss out, I&#8217;d advise you skip reading the rest of this introduction and jump straight to the registration form.This year we&#8217;ve teamed up with O&#8217;Reilly to produce the conference, which means that silly-nilly details like which sessions will be available are actually ready for you to peruse before signing up. This goes for the new-to-this-year first day of tutorials too. What a luxury treat. And on top of sessions and tutorials, we&#8217;ll of course also have a slew of keynotes.It&#8217;s going to be one heck of a show. I can&#8217;t wait to see your all there." />
