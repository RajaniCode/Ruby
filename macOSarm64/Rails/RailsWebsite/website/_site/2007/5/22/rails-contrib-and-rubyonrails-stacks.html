#rails-contrib is a new IRC channel on freenode for contributors to Rails. The Rails core team will hang out there to answer questions, discuss patches, and generally interact with anyone doing implementation work for the Rails framework. It’s not meant for general chatter, though. Or for how to use the framework. It’s strictly for implementational issues and the contributors working on those.
