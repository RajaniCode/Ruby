<p>Install it thus:</p>
<p>gem install capistrano</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been through four preview releases, and has seen significant changes since 1.4.1. If you&#8217;re currently using 1.4.1, be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.capify.org/upgrade">upgrade documentation</a> at <a href="http://www.capify.org">http://www.capify.org</a>. If you&#8217;re altogether new to Capistrano, you might like to read about <a href="http://www.capify.org/getting-started">getting started</a>.</p>
<p>Since the last preview release (number four, version 1.99.3), the changes are primarily bug fixes, but the following featureish modifications snuck in, too:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The uploader has added a tiny bit of sleep to prevent the <span class="caps">CPU</span> from going bonkers during uploads.</li>
	<li>You can specify the $<span class="caps">CAPISTRANO</span>:<span class="caps">HOST</span>$ placeholder in the filenames that you give to &#8220;put&#8221;, and it will be replaced with the actual host that the file is being uploaded to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, some people reported <span class="caps">SFTP</span> uploads were hanging for them. If this happens to you, try adding the following line to the top of your recipe file:</p>
<p>set :synchronous_connect, true</p>
<p>That will cause connections to the servers to be established serially, rather than in parallel, so if you&#8217;ve got a lot of servers that you are connecting to, it might make things a bit time-consuming.

<p>Yes, there are a few of these. Two are of immediate significance:</p>
