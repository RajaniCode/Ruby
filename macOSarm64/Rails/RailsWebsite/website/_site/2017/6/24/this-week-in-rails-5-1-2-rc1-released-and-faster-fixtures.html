        <p>Hi there! This is <a href="http://github.com/kirs">Kir</a>Â from chilling Ottawa, bringing you another edition of This Week in Rails. Letâ€™s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="featured">Featured</h2>

<h3 id="-this-weeks-rails-contributors-"><a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20170617-20170623">ðŸŽ‰ This Weekâ€™s Rails contributors! ðŸŽ‰</a></h3>

<p>We had 21 awesome people who helped make Rails better this week, with one first-time contributor! Would you like to help as well? Head over to the ðŸ‘‰ <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues">issues list</a>.</p>

<h2 id="new">New</h2>

<h3 id="-rails-429rc2-504-and-512rc1-have-been-released-"><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2017/6/20/Rails-5-1-2-rc1-has-been-released">ðŸŽ‰ Rails 4.2.9.rc2, 5.0.4 and 5.1.2rc1 have been released ðŸŽ‰</a></h3>

<p>Itâ€™s your chance to help us discover bugs in 4.2.9 and 5.1.2 release candidates. Also, Rails 4.2.9 will be the last release in 4.2 series, so itâ€™s time to upgrade if your app is still running on Rails 4.</p>

<h2 id="perf">Perf</h2>

<h3 id="use-bulk-insert-to-insert-fixtures"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/29504">Use bulk INSERT to insert fixtures</a></h3>

<p>Inserting fixtures in test environment became significantly faster by using one bulk INSERT query instead of many single INSERTs.</p>

<h2 id="fixed">Fixed</h2>

<h3 id="current_page-helper-now-works-from-within-a-rails-engine"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/29503">current_page? helper now works from within a Rails Engine</a></h3>

<p>Due a bug related to a trailing slash, <em>current_page?</em>Â helper always returned false while it was supposed to return true when it was called from a Rails Engine route.</p>

<h3 id="keep-inner-join-when-merging-relations"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/27063">Keep INNER JOIN when merging relations</a></h3>

<p>Now you can safely merge two ActiveRecord relations both having a JOIN. Previously, that would to query with LEFT OUTER JOIN instead of INNER JOIN.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it for this week, as always, we couldnâ€™t cover all of the changes, but feel free to check all the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/master@%7B2017-06-17%7D...@%7B2017-06-23%7D">commits</a> from this week.</p>

<p>Until next week! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹</p>
