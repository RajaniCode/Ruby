        <p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gregmolnar">Greg</a> here with the latest from the world of Rails. It was a busy week with new releases and many improvements!</p>

<h2 id="featured">Featured</h2>

<h3 id="new-rails-releases"><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2017/2/23/Rails-5-1-beta1">New Rails releases</a></h3>

<p>The first beta release for <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2017/2/23/Rails-5-1-beta1">5.1.0</a> is out with some love towards JavaScript, System Tests, Encrypted Secrets and more! <br />
There is also a new stable release for <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2017/2/21/Rails-4-2-8-has-been-released">4.2.8</a> and a release candidate for <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2017/2/25/Rails-5-0-2-rc1-has-been-released">5.0.2</a></p>

<h3 id="eileen-joins-rails-core"><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2017/2/22/Eileen-joins-Rails-core">Eileen joins Rails core</a></h3>

<p>Weâ€™re proud to welcome Eileen M. Uchitelle to Rails core!</p>

<h3 id="this-weeks-rails-contributors"><a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20170219-20170225">This weekâ€™s Rails Contributors</a></h3>

<p>33 developers contributed to Rails this week. If you want to be part of this team, look at the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues">issues list</a> and make a contribution!</p>

<h2 id="new">New</h2>

<h3 id="custom-url-helpers-and-polymorphic-mapping"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/23138">Custom url helpers and polymorphic mapping</a></h3>

<p>This pull request introduces support for custom url helpers and defining custom polymorphic mappings in routes.rb</p>

<h3 id="capybara-integration-with-rails-aka-system-tests"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/26703">Capybara Integration with Rails (AKA System Tests)</a></h3>

<p>Rails has a built in integration with Capybara now which makes writing system tests easier, since all the setup is handled by Rails. For more details read the write-up on the pull request.</p>

<h3 id="encrypted-secrets-support"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/28038">Encrypted secrets support</a></h3>

<p>Rails introduces secrets encryption which is inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/ahoward/sekrets">Sekrets</a> gem.<br />
It worth noting here that, some <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/28139">improvements to the crypto</a> is on the way too.</p>

<h2 id="improved">Improved</h2>

<h3 id="include-jobid-in-all-active-job-info-logs"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/28112">Include JobID in all Active Job info logs</a></h3>

<p>Earlier the JobID wasnâ€™t logged when a job started or ended performing, but thatâ€™s not the case anymore, making debugging of job related issues easier.</p>

<h3 id="add-missing-gzip-footer-check-in-activesupportgzipdecompress"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/28158">Add missing gzip footer check in ActiveSupport::Gzip.decompress</a></h3>

<p>From now on ActiveSupport::Gzip.decompress checks the CRC in the gzip footer.</p>

<h3 id="allow-3-level-configs-to-group-database-connections-by-environment"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/28095">Allow 3-level configs to group database connections by environment</a></h3>

<p>If you have multiple database connection per environment, you can group your config by the environment. <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/28095#issuecomment-281449457">Check this comment</a> for an example.</p>

<h3 id="delegate-to-scope-rather-than-merge-for-collection-proxy"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/25877">Delegate to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scope</code> rather than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">merge!</code> for collection proxy</a></h3>

<p>A performance improvement by not using merge! when it is not necessary.</p>

<h2 id="fixed">Fixed</h2>

<h3 id="preload-to_datetime-before-freezing-a-timewithzone-instance"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/28104">Preload to_datetime before freezing a TimeWithZone instance</a></h3>

<p>After freezing an ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone instance, it is not possible to call to_datetime because the value is cached in an instance variable. To avoid this issue, the instance variable is preloaded before the freeze occurs.</p>

<h3 id="hashwithindifferentaccesscompat-nil-issue-fix"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/28138">HashWithIndifferentAccess#compat nil issue fix</a></h3>

<p>HashWithIndifferentAccess#compact returned nil earlier when the hash didnâ€™t contain nil values in it. This PR fixed the problem.</p>

<h2 id="deprecated">Deprecated</h2>

<h3 id="deprecate-using-quoted_id-in-quoting--type-casting"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/27962">Deprecate using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">quoted_id</code> in quoting / type casting</a></h3>

<p>Originally quoted_id was used in legacy quoting mechanism. Now we use type casting mechanism for that hence quoted_id is deprecated.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it from This Week in Rails. There were many other great contributions, too numerous to list here, but feel free to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/master@%7B2017-02-12%7D...@%7B2017-02-19%7D">check them out</a>!Â </p>

<p>Until next week ðŸ‘£</p>
