        <p>Hello! This is your host <a href="https://twitter.com/andatki">Andy</a>, bringing you another edition of This Week in Rails.</p>

<p>I’m in a cold Northern climate ❄️️ and we’re in the middle of Winter right now. To me, it’s the best time of the year to stay inside and dive into some new code. Let’s take a look at some of the latest changes made to Ruby on Rails in the past week.</p>

<h2 id="featured">Featured</h2>

<h3 id="this-weeks-rails-contributors"><a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20170128-20170203">This Week’s Rails Contributors</a></h3>

<p>We had 31 contributors this week. There are lots of PRs for bug fixes which are nice to see. Many thanks to all of the contributors!</p>

<h2 id="new">New</h2>

<h3 id="add-warnings-option-to-test-runner"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/27784">Add warnings option to test runner</a></h3>

<p>This change provides an option to enable Ruby’s warnings in tests.</p>

<h2 id="improved">Improved</h2>

<h3 id="refactor-active-record-reflections"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/27851">Refactor Active Record reflections</a></h3>

<p>This PR refactors reflections such that we can iterate over each reflection and ask the reflection object what scopes should be applied to the query we are currently building.</p>

<h3 id="report-the-attribute-on-activerecordserializationtypemismatch"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/27773">Report the attribute on ActiveRecord::SerializationTypeMismatch</a></h3>

<p>When a <em>ActiveRecord::SerializationTypeMismatch</em> error occurs, we will now know which attribute caused the error.</p>

<h3 id="simplify-query-in-column_definitions-for-postgres"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/27743">Simplify query in column_definitions() for Postgres</a></h3>

<p>This patch updates how column_definitions() for Postgres is calculated. The author has a nice usage of the EXPLAIN tool, to show that the new implementation is more efficient.</p>

<h2 id="fixes">Fixes</h2>

<h3 id="reload-through_record-that-has-been-destroyed"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e09da8bf7853f8f4f1ebb5c52f9b688a32b4dfaa">Reload <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">through_record</code> that has been destroyed</a></h3>

<p>For <em>has_one :through</em> associations, if <em>through_proxy</em> is not reset, setting a new record causes the runtime error <em>Can’t modify frozen hash</em>.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>That’s it from This Week in Rails. There were many other great contributions, too numerous to list here, but feel free to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/master@%7B2017-01-29%7D...@%7B2017-02-03%7D">check them out</a>!</p>

<p>Catch you next week!</p>
