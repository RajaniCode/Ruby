        <p>We’re very happy to announce that Ruby on Rails has been accepted as an
organization for the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> (GSoC) 2017 edition!</p>

<p>The GSoC is a program proposed by Google that allows college students (who are at
least 18 years old) to contribute to open source projects during the summer (from
May 30 to August 21) and get paid for that!</p>

<p>Rails has already participated in the past and many different projects have been
achieved through this program and are now invaluable in the framework’s ecosystem
like the <a href="https://github.com/rails/web-console">web console</a>, the <a href="https://rubybench.org/">RubyBench</a> site or the
<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails-ujs">rails-ujs</a> project.</p>

<p>Students need to propose an idea that will improve the project they are willing
to work on and eventually the different steps that will be tackled to achieve
it. Throughout the process, students are guided by one or several mentors. Mentors
are here to make sure that students go in the right direction and help them
if they stumble against problems.</p>

<p>This can be a very interesting and rewarding experience for students as they can
learn a lot from more experienced developers and it’s an easy way to get involved
in the open source world.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/railsgsoc/ideas/wiki/2017-Ideas">list of possible ideas</a> is already available if you want to work on
Ruby on Rails this summer but feel free to propose your own if you want to work
on something different and you still think it can be valuable for the project.</p>

<p>If you are interested in getting involved, please join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rubyonrails-gsoc">mailing list</a>
and let us know what you would like to work on. Thus, you can get early feedback
and avoid going in the wrong direction or putting too much effort in a project
that may not be accepted.</p>

<p>Student applications will be open on March 20 and will end on April 3. Make
sure to keep an eye on the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">timeline</a> if you are willing to participate
to this program. You can find the application template on <a href="https://github.com/railsgsoc/ideas/wiki/Ruby-on-Rails-Application-Template">our wiki</a>.</p>

<p>If you are not a student, you can still get involved by participating on the
mailing list or by applying as a mentor!</p>

<p>As a side note, a similar project is available and is aiming at getting more
women involved in the open source world: <a href="https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/">Rails Girls Summer of Code</a>.
Unlike GSoC, this project is exclusively about Ruby on Rails, it’s not restricted
to students and there are no age limitations. Applications are open and will close
very soon though, on March 8.</p>
