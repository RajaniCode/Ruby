We&#8217;re hell bent on repeating that for 2009, but we need your help.The call for proposals has opened and will stay open until February 17th, 2009. That&#8217;s a really long call for proposals and we&#8217;re doing it to get even more timely information available for the conference. If Rails 3.0 magically appears in January, we want to make sure there are sessions covering it.The registration for the conference will open in January of 2009." />
