If you register before July 15th, you can save up to 150 euros.Considering what a blow-out success we had at RailsConf in Portland just a few weeks ago, it&#8217;s hard not to be pretty darn excited about setting up in Berlin and extending that good atmosphere across the pond. Berlin was a great spot in September last year as well.So I&#8217;m looking forward to meeting up with more from the European Rails communities. Hopefully the very large Danish delegation will make it down this year as well :)." />
