Rails 2.2 will be thread safe thanks to the work that Josh has put into it.Of more importance, though, is the significant effort put into making things faster and cleaner as part of that push. The actual thread safety won&#8217;t really matter much to most people, but it&#8217;ll surely look nice on your enterprisey check list of Features Your Framework Must Have To Get Play Around Here.In any case, please welcome Josh!" />
