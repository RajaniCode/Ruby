It&#8217;s just so much easier to deal with and the memory savings you get through REE are a nice cherry on top.I keep getting a steady stream of success reports from all over the world as well. I&#8217;ve even read of a few people getting back into Rails development because Passenger finally took out the inconvenience of deploying.It&#8217;s hard to argue with the usability. I&#8217;ve personally been setting up a new server running Ubuntu 8.10 and using Apache 2 with Passenger. The time it took me to go from a fresh install to a complete production setup was ridiculously low.
