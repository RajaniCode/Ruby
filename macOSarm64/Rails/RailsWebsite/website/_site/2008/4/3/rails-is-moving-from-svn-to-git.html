So now both our repository and ticket tracking will be powered by Rails applications, which is a nice bonus treat.When the move happens, we&#8217;ll freeze the existing Subversion repository and the Trac installation. Both will live on for a long time to come, but will be entirely deprecated. This means that your existing svn:externals will not break, but if you want the latest edge, you&#8217;ll have to get it from the new git repository.So now is a great time to learn more about Git in anticipation of this move. I recommend starting with the Git for SVN&#8217;ers crash course." />
