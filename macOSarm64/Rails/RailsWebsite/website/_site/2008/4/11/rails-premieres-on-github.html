  <meta name="description" content="GitHub has now officially launched and Rails is right there at the premiere. The Rails repository now lives at rails/rails and you can check it out with:git clone git://github.com/rails/rails.gitIf you don&#8217;t have git, or don&#8217;t enjoy running it on your platform, you need not fear. We&#8217;ve set up an automated task to produce a zip file of Rails Edge that&#8217;ll be kept up to date all the time: http://dev.rubyonrails.org/archives/rails_edge.zip. This is also what we&#8217;ve made the new rake rails:freeze:edge use.This also means that development on the Subversion repository has stopped and will no longer be kept up to date. We&#8217;ll keep the Subversion repository around for some time for people to transition off svn:externals, though. But if you want the latest edge, you&#8217;ll have to use either git or the new zip files.We&#8217;ll also soon go live with our new ticket management system, which will be running on a new version of Lighthouse. When that happens, the Trac installation will follow the Subversion repository into legacy. We&#8217;ll still keep it around so we can work through all the patches and tickets that are there, but everything new will happen on the Lighthouse setup.We hope you&#8217;ll enjoy this upgrade to the Rails collaboration infrastructure. We&#8217;re really looking forward to the onslaught of marvelous patches that the Git lords have promised us will flow from the mountain now." />
