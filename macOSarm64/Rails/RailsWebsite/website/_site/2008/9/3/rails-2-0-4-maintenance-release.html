So if you&#8217;re on 2.0 and haven&#8217;t dealt with the issue already, you can upgrade to 2.0.4 and get it fixed.You can install with: gem install rails --version 2.0.4See all the changesUPDATE: The actual 2.0.4 gem didn&#8217;t get published yesterday due to a bug in the release script. It&#8217;s been fixed and 2.0.4 is actually available on the main gem repository. Sorry about that!" />
