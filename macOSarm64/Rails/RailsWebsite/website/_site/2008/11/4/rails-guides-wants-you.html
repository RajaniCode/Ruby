The new Ruby on Rails Guides page includes 14 separate guides for Rails developers, with topics ranging from &#8220;Getting Started&#8221; to routing, security, testing, and debugging. That&#8217;s over 70,000 words of help content for Rails users that didn&#8217;t exist two months ago when we launched the Rails Guides project.But we&#8217;re not done yet! We&#8217;re starting phase 2 of the Guides project, and planning a fresh batch of content to add to what&#8217;s already there. Our goal is to have a single page where you can find all of the information you need to be an effective Rails developer. Remember, though: this is open source. That means we want your help too!Here&#8217;s what you can do to get involved:	Read about the process of and rewards for contributing on the Hackfest page.	Check the list of available tickets in our Lighthouse project, and sign up to write a guide.	Submit corrections, suggestion, bugs, or patches for the existing guides. You&#8217;ll find a link to the relevant Lighthouse ticket at the bottom of each guide.	Let us know what other guides you think should be added &#8211; whether you want to write them, or just hope that someone else will. Just leave a note in the comments here and we&#8217;ll get your idea into the process.You&#8217;ll usually find some of the documentation team hanging around in #docrails on IRC.
