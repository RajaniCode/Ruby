That&#8217;s great to see.But what I think is even more interesting is the progress we&#8217;ve been making on performance optimizations for more substantial applications. Rails 2.0 made a lot of progress for applications with lots of assets and for ones with big routes.rb files. The forthcoming Rails 2.1 will move things forward even further.UPDATE: Hongli also investigated memory consumption on 1.2 vs 2.0 and found 2.0 to be significantly slimmer. Nice!" />
