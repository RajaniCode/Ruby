The conference is returning to Berlin and the conference will happen between the 2nd and 4th of September.Last year was an absolute blast. There&#8217;s such a great diversity of people from all over Europe and beyond. It&#8217;s a great addition to the much more US-focused bang of RailsConf in the US.Also, have in mind that the program for RailsConf Europe is usually pretty much completely different from the US fanfare. So it&#8217;s okay to submit your proposal here as well. What might be accepted at RailsConf in the US might not go for RailsConf Europe and vice versa.Anyway, looking forward to reading about those proposals!" />
