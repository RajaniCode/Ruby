But there are two books that I&#8217;ve recently have had a chance to taste that I&#8217;d like to highlight.The first is The Rails Way by Obie Fernandez, which I wrote the foreword for. It&#8217;s a big whooper of a book (900+ pages!), but also a very comprehensive walk-through for the Rails developer who already has his feet wet. It also includes a good dose of community commentary on the how&#8217;s and why&#8217;s, which I rather like.The second is Mike Clark&#8217;s Advanced Rails Recipes, which is still not finished, but there&#8217;s a beta book available. It takes up from Chad Fowler&#8217;s original Rails Recipes book and gives you another 72 how-tos on more in-depth topics, such as REST, deployment, and testing. I&#8217;ve had a chance to taste a few of the recipes already and it&#8217;s good stuff.If there&#8217;s a new Rails book that you really like, write a note in the comments and point people to it." />
