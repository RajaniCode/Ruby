        <p>Happy Friday! It’s <a href="https://claudiob.github.io">Claudio</a> with the latest updates on Rails. Overall, this has been a relaxed week. Many documentation fixes have made their way into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> while features uncovered at RailsConf (like the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/19832">integration of Rails API</a>) are being heavily discussed on GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="featured">Featured</h2>

<h3 id="this-weeks-contributors"><a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20150425-20150501">This Week’s Contributors</a></h3>

<p>This week 31 people helped Rails out. Six people had their first commit merged into rails/rails. Hooray!</p>

<h3 id="railsconf-2015-videos"><a href="http://confreaks.tv/events/railsconf2015">RailsConf 2015 videos</a></h3>

<p>One by one, all the presentations of RailsConf are being uploaded. Lots of great talks to fill your weekend!</p>

<h3 id="gsoc-students-announced"><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2015/5/2/welcome-to-gsoc-15">GSoC students announced!</a></h3>

<p>We are proud to announce that 8 students will be working on improving Rails as part of the Google Summer of Code 2015. Congratulations and welcome to Rails!</p>

<h2 id="improved">Improved</h2>

<h3 id="better-docs-for-minitest-assertions"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/a66a64aa2a82b755f754bd42b8a4a4697ac89f83">Better docs for minitest assertions</a></h3>

<p>Rails ships with minitest by default but has different naming conventions for inverse assertion methods. The new guides clarify this difference. And give us a great excuse to link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA4jJNUG_dI">Ruby on Rails on Minitest</a>.</p>

<h3 id="toward-a-better-caching-with-rails-guide"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/ae5c5b2237ee4c1aae98a048c09b6a98bd352475">Toward a better “Caching with Rails” guide</a></h3>

<p>Everyone can help make Rails better by improving its guides. <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html">“Caching with Rails”</a> is an awesome place to start. If you think you can improve it, don’t hesitate to submit a pull request!</p>

<h3 id="remove-use-of-mocha-in-the-named-base-tests"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/3ca5ae57b517b7a5a8d07dff83703dcd1f199870">Remove use of mocha in the named-base tests</a></h3>

<p>Some tests in the Rails codebase use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mocha</code> library and can be faster by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minitest/mock</code> instead. This commit fixes one of those tests; you are all invited to do the same for <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=%22stop+using+mocha%22&amp;type=Code">the remaining ones</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fixed">Fixed</h2>

<h3 id="rake-routes-not-showing-right-format-when-nested"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/18373">Rake routes not showing right format when nested</a></h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rake routes</code> command was not properly showing nested routes with a scope constraint for the format override by a resource… but that just got fixed!</p>

<h2 id="thats-a-wrap">That’s a wrap</h2>

<p>That’s all for This week in Rails. As always, there are more changes than we have room to cover here, but feel free to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">check them out yourself</a>!</p>
