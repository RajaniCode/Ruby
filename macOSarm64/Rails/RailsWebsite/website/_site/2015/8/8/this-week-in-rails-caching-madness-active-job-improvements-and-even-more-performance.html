        <p>What’s up, gang? <a href="https://twitter.com/toddbealmear">Todd</a> here with another edition of This Week in Rails. It was a bit of a quiet week in <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">Railsland</a>, but I think we’ve got some quality contributions here. Read on for the deets!</p>

<h2 id="featured">Featured</h2>

<h3 id="this-weeks-rails-contributors"><a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20150801-201508072100">This Week’s Rails Contributors</a></h3>

<p>We had 39 awesome contributors to the Rails codebase this week. Check out the active <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues">issues</a> over on GitHub if you’d like to see your name here.</p>

<h2 id="new-stuff">New Stuff</h2>

<h3 id="add-cache_key-to-activerecordrelation"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/20884">Add #cache_key to ActiveRecord::Relation</a></h3>

<p>This addition bakes a strategy for generating collection cache keys directly into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ActiveRecord::Relation</code>. Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#cache_key</code>, it’s now possible to automagically generate a unique key on relations for use with Rails’ fragment cache.</p>

<h3 id="development-server-caching-toggle"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/20961">Development Server Caching Toggle</a></h3>

<p>Per a <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/18875">request from DHH</a>, this change adds the ability to enable or disable caching in a development environment. There are two ways to toggle it - on server start with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--[no-]dev-caching</code> or with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dev:cache</code> rake task.</p>

<h2 id="improved">Improved</h2>

<h3 id="active-job-and-locales"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/20800">Active Job and Locales</a></h3>

<p>Active Jobs queued with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#perform_later</code> previously wouldn’t honor the context’s locale. This patch rectifies that by storing it on the job directly.</p>

<h3 id="even-more-performance-improvements"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/21100">Even More Performance Improvements!</a></h3>

<p>By using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#start_with?</code> instead of matching on a regex, 765.5 ms have been shaved off of the total aggregate request time per 1000 requests. In conjunction with other performance work recently completed, this knocks a whopping 1.5 <em>seconds</em> off over the course of 1000 requests.</p>

<h2 id="thats-a-wrap">That’s a wrap</h2>

<p>That’s all for This week in Rails. As always, there are many more changes than we have room to cover here, but feel free to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/master@%7B2015-08-01%7D...@%7B2015-08-07%7D">check them out yourself</a>!</p>
