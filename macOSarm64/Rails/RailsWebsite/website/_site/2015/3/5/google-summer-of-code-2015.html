        <p>We’re happy to announce that Ruby on Rails will once again be part of Google’s Summer of Code
(GSoC) in 2015. The GSoC is a global program where students can contribute to open source projects
and get paid while doing so. Every project has at least one community member that will act
as mentor for the duration of the program. The only requirements for students applying are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Being at least 18 years old.</li>
  <li>Being enlisted as a part or full-time college student.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the work done in the past years includes the web-console shipped with Rails 4.2 and
<a href="http://rubybench.org/">RubyBench.org</a>, a long running suite of Ruby benchmarks. You can see the
full list of projects from previous years here: <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2013/5/27/rails-google-summer-of-code-projects/">2013</a>, <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2014/5/23/meet-our-google-summer-of-code-students-and-mentors/">2014</a>.</p>

<p>We have started writing down a list of ideas for this year, you can find it in the <a href="https://github.com/railsgsoc/ideas/wiki/2015-Ideas">Rails GSoC
Wiki</a>. This summer we want to focus on fixing
existing problems instead of adding new user facing features. If you are interested in
getting involved please join our <a href="http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rubyonrails-gsoc">mailing list</a> and let us know what you’d like to
work on.</p>

<p>Student applications can be submitted starting March 16 and the deadline is March 27. If you’re
wondering what’s involved in becoming a GSoC student then the <a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCStudentGuide/">Google Student
Guide</a> has all the details on what’s expected and what
you will gain from taking part in the program.</p>

<p>What if you’re not a student? You can still help out by discussing ideas on the mailing list,
and if have previous experience contributing to Rails and are willing to make a strong commitment to
help out the next generation of developers, you can <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/profile/register/org_member/google/gsoc2015">apply to be a
mentor</a>.</p>
