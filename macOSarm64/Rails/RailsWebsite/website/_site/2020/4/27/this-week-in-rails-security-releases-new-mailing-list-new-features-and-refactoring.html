Overwhelmed by all the latest pandemic news? Why not take a break with some
exciting Rails news?</p>

<h3 id="security-fixes"><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2020/3/19/Rails-6-0-2-2-and-5-2-4-2-has-been-released">Security Fixes</a></h3>

<p>Rails 6.0.2.2 and 5.2.4.2 were recently released to fix a XSS vulnerability in
Action View. If you are not running one of these versions, it is time to
upgrade. While you are at it, it is also time to <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/releases/">upgrade to Ruby 2.5.8, 2.6.6,
or 2.7.1</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ruby-on-rails-on-discourse"><a href="https://discuss.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails on Discourse</a></h3>

<p>The Ruby on Rails mailing list has migrated to https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/.
If you would like to suggest changes or new features, discuss documentation, or
ask questions about Rails, this is the place to be.</p>

<h3 id="annotate-html-output-with-template-names"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/38848">Annotate HTML output with template names</a></h3>

<p>If you have ever opened your HTML source in the browser and wondered which
templates were rendering which part of the page, this feature is for you.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.action_view.annotate_template_file_names</code> adds HTML comments to the
rendered output indicating where each template begins and ends. I am a fan of
this feature, and I also like the clear problem statement in the commit message
and PR description.</p>

<h3 id="quickly-generate-a-rails-app-pointing-to-master"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/38631">Quickly generate a Rails app pointing to master</a></h3>

<p>If you are anything like me, you want to try out new Rails features the moment
they are merged. Why wait? Now generating a new Rails app pointing to master is
as simple as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rails new &lt;app_name&gt; --master</code>.</p>

<h3 id="just-simply-improve-the-documentation"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/37946">Just simply improve the documentation</a></h3>

<p>Removing words like ‚Äújust‚Äù and ‚Äúsimple‚Äù from the documentation might seem like a
small change, but removing these superfluous words can make for a significantly
more welcoming experience to folks who are struggling. üòç</p>

<h3 id="use-index_by-and-index_with-wherever-possible"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/38646">Use index_by and index_with wherever possible</a></h3>

<p>I haven‚Äôt used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index_by</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index_with</code> before, but seeing this PR makes me
want to try them out. It certainly looks nicer than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">map { ... }.to_h</code>. And if
you really like these methods you can enforce that with a new rubocop-rails cop.</p>

<h3 id="and-plenty-of-refactoring"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/search?q=Refactor+committer-date%3A%3E2020-03-01+merge%3Afalse&amp;unscoped_q=Refactor+committer-date%3A%3E2020-03-01+merge%3Afalse&amp;type=Commits">And plenty of refactoring</a></h3>

<p>Eileen refactored <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/38636">invert_predicate</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/38719">fetch_attribute</a> to get rid of some
case statements in favor of a more object oriented approach. Aaron refactored
the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/38594">PartialRenderer</a>, splitting out classes for rendering single objects and
collections. John improved some things by making <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/38857">ActionView rendering
instrumentation</a> less DRY (sometimes WET code is better!).</p>

<p><a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20200301-20200426">106 people contributed</a> since our last issue. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/master@%7B2020-03-01%7D...@%7B2020-04-26%7D">full list of
changes</a> and Stay healthy out there!</p>
