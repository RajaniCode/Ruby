So here we are kicking off the first Ruby summer of code together with Engine Yard and Ruby Central.Head over to rubysoc.org to get started and start following @rubysoc for news.We&#8217;re following Google&#8217;s example closely:	students are paid a $5000 stipend to work full-time during their summer break	a group of Ruby gurus volunteer their time as mentors	mentors vote on student proposals based on usefulness, benefit to the Ruby community, and history of motivated open source contributionWe&#8217;re looking for full- and half-summer sponsors as well as individual donations. We&#8217;ll fund as many students as we can. Donate this week and our own Aaron aka tenderlove will match it! Aaron tapped out, you dogs :-) Thanks Aaron! Now Chad and Kelly Fowler are matching! Donate now!Ruby gurus, consider mentoring a student this summer. Volunteering to guide the next generation of Ruby developers is a challenging and rewarding effort.Students: start your engines! Check out our ideas list and start brainstorming. Applications begin on April 5!" />

        <p>Rails participated in Google&#8217;s summer of code program for the <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2009/3/19/get-paid-to-work-on-rails">first time</a> last year. We got <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/2009/4/22/2009-rails-google-summer-of-code-projects">four great projects</a> and three long-term contributors from the effort, including Josh Peek and José Valim, who&#8217;ve both joined Rails core, and Emilio Tagua, who revitalized Arel and integrated it with Active Record.</p>
<p>We applied again this year but didn&#8217;t make the cut, so we moped for a day then thought, why not make this happen ourselves. So here we are kicking off the <strong>first Ruby summer of code</strong> together with <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">Engine Yard</a> and <a href="http://rubycentral.org/">Ruby Central</a>.</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="http://rubysoc.org/">rubysoc.org</a> to get started and start following <a href="http://twitter.com/rubysoc">@rubysoc</a> for news.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re following Google&#8217;s example closely:</p>
<ul>
	<li>students are paid a $5000 stipend to work full-time during their summer break</li>
	<li>a group of Ruby gurus volunteer their time as mentors</li>
	<li>mentors vote on student proposals based on usefulness, benefit to the Ruby community, and history of motivated open source contribution</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;re looking for full- and half-summer sponsors as well as <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=lsilber@engineyard.com&amp;item_name=Ruby_Summer_of_Code&amp;item_number=Donation&amp;no_shipping=1&amp;return=http://www.rubysoc.org&amp;cancel_return=http://www.rubysoc.org/cancel.html&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=USD&amp;lc=US&amp;bn=PP_DonationsBF">individual donations</a>.
