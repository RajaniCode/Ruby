  <meta name="description" content="To this day I still hear people complain that Rails has poor documentation.  From where I&#8217;m sitting this seems far from the truth.  Let me lay out the evidence piece by piece:RailsTutorial.orgTo learn Rails from scratch Michael Hartl recently finished his book Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example.  The book teaches Rails 3 from the ground up and it&#8217;s available for FREE online.  If you&#8217;d rather have a PDF or a book you can grab that as well (and he&#8217;s even working on some screencasts).The source for the finalized book will be pushed to GitHub and released under a Creative Commons License shortly after Rails 3 is done.  If you&#8217;d like to help translate the book to your language of choice, feel free to contact Michael and he&#8217;ll get in touch when it&#8217;s time to make it happen.Rails GuidesIf you&#8217;re not a Rails newbie don&#8217;t forget about the Rails Guides, which have been updated for Rails 3.Rails API DocsThere are two main websites I use to do API lookups.  The first is Rails Searchable API Doc, which has online and offline searchable documentation. The second is APIdock which is online only, but has the ability to comment and easily compare different versions of documentation.Rails 3 Free ScreencastsIf you&#8217;re more of a visual learner (like me) then there are plenty of free screencasts to teach you about Rails 3.  About 2 months ago I produced the Rails 3 Screencasts, which will get you started.Ryan Bates has also produced an incredible amount of Rails 3 screencasts over on Railscasts.com.  Ryan has been producing Railscasts for over 3 1/2 years, isn&#8217;t that crazy?There&#8217;s also a few good free screencasts over on Teach me to Code by Charles Max Wood.Keeping on the EdgeIf you find yourself wondering how to keep up with all of the newest features / libraries for Rails 3, both the Ruby5 Podcast and the Ruby Show are going strong.  Don&#8217;t listen to audio? It doesn&#8217;t matter, just subscribe to the Ruby5 RSS feed and get links with descriptions to all the newest libraries, tutorials, and more.  You might also want to checkout Peter Cooper&#8217;s new Ruby Weekly, a Ruby email newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.Need to upgrade a big app to Rails 3?Jeremy McAnally&#8217;s Rails 3 Upgrade Handbook PDF is just $12.  There&#8217;s also a few paid screencasts for the upgrade over on Thinkcode.tv and BDDCasts.Need a Book?There&#8217;s a bunch of books that will be coming out after the release, most of which you can start reading now. The Rails 3 Way by Obie Fernandez, Rails 3 In Action by Ryan Bigg and Yehuda Katz, Beginning Rails by Cloves Carneiro Jr and Rida Al Barazi, and of course the Agile Web Development with Rails:fourth edition by Sam Ruby, Dave Thomas, and David Heinemeier Hansson.In conclusionNo more complaining about lack of good documentation!  Seriously. If you want even more Rails 3 content, check out the blog post by Kevin Faustino on 34 Ruby on Rails 3 resources to get you started." />

        <p>To this day I still hear people complain that Rails has poor documentation.  From where I&#8217;m sitting this seems far from the truth.  Let me lay out the evidence piece by piece:</p>
<p><a href="http://railstutorial.org/book"><img src="/assets/2010/8/28/railstutorial.gif" style="float:right" /></a><br />
<strong>RailsTutorial.org</strong></p>
<p>To learn Rails from scratch Michael Hartl recently finished his book <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example</a>.  The book teaches Rails 3 from the ground up and it&#8217;s <a href="http://railstutorial.org/book">available for <strong><span class="caps">FREE</span></strong> online</a>.  If you&#8217;d rather have a <a href="http://railstutorial.org/#buy"><span class="caps">PDF</span></a> or a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Rails-Tutorial-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321743121">book</a> you can grab that as well (and he&#8217;s even working on some <a href="http://railstutorial.org/screencasts">screencasts</a>).</p>
<p>The source for the finalized book will be pushed to GitHub and released under a Creative Commons License shortly after Rails 3 is done.  If you&#8217;d like to help translate the book to your language of choice, feel free to <a href="http://www.michaelhartl.com/" title="Michael Hartl">contact Michael</a> and he&#8217;ll get in touch when it&#8217;s time to make it happen.</p>
<p><strong>Rails Guides</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not a Rails newbie don&#8217;t forget about the <a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Guides</a>, which have been updated for Rails 3.</p>
<p><strong>Rails <span class="caps">API</span> Docs</strong></p>
<p>There are two main websites I use to do <span class="caps">API</span> lookups.  The first is <a href="http://railsapi.com">Rails Searchable <span class="caps">API</span> Doc</a>, which has online and offline searchable documentation. The second is <a href="http://apidock.com/rails">APIdock</a> which is online only, but has the ability to comment and easily compare different versions of documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Rails 3 Free Screencasts</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re more of a visual learner (like me) then there are plenty of free screencasts to teach you about Rails 3.  About 2 months ago I produced the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/screencasts/rails3">Rails 3 Screencasts</a>, which will get you started.</p>
<p>Ryan Bates has also produced an incredible amount of Rails 3 screencasts over on <a href="http://railscasts.com/tags/27">Railscasts.com</a>.  Ryan has been producing Railscasts for over 3 1/2 years, isn&#8217;t that crazy?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a few good free screencasts over on <a href="http://teachmetocode.com/screencasts/tag/rails-3/">Teach me to Code</a> by Charles Max Wood.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping on the Edge</strong></p>
<p>If you find yourself wondering how to keep up with all of the newest features / libraries for Rails 3, both the <a href="http://ruby5.codeschool.com">Ruby5 Podcast</a> and the <a href="http://rubyshow.com">Ruby Show</a> are going strong.  Don&#8217;t listen to audio? It doesn&#8217;t matter, just subscribe to the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Ruby5">Ruby5 <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed</a> and get links with descriptions to all the newest libraries, tutorials, and more.  You might also want to checkout Peter Cooper&#8217;s new <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/">Ruby Weekly</a>, a Ruby email newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.</p>
<p><strong>Need to upgrade a big app to Rails 3?</strong></p>
<p>Jeremy McAnally&#8217;s <a href="http://www.railsupgradehandbook.com/">Rails 3 Upgrade Handbook <span class="caps">PDF</span></a> is just $12.  There&#8217;s also a few paid screencasts for the upgrade over on <a href="http://thinkcode.tv/catalog/upgrading-rails-3/">Thinkcode.tv</a> and <a href="http://bddcasts.com/">BDDCasts</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Need a Book?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a bunch of books that will be coming out after the release, most of which you can start reading now. <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780132480345">The Rails 3 Way</a> by Obie Fernandez, <a href="http://www.manning.com/katz/">Rails 3 In Action</a> by Ryan Bigg and Yehuda Katz, <a href="http://beginningrails.com/">Beginning Rails</a> by Cloves Carneiro Jr and Rida Al Barazi, and of course the <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails">Agile Web Development with Rails</a>:fourth edition by Sam Ruby, Dave Thomas, and David Heinemeier Hansson.</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>
<p>No more complaining about lack of good documentation!  Seriously.
