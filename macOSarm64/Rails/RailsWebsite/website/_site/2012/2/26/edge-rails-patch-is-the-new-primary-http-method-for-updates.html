        <h2 id="what-is-patch">What is PATCH?</h2>

<p>The HTTP method PUT means resource <em>creation</em> or <em>replacement</em> at some given URL.</p>

<p>Think files, for example. If you upload a file to S3 at some URL, you want
either to create the file at that URL or replace an existing file if there’s
one. That is PUT.</p>

<p>Now let’s say a web application has an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Invoice</code> model with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">paid</code> flag that
indicates whether the invoice has been paid. How do you set that flag in a
RESTful way? Submitting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">paid=1</code> via PUT to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/invoices/:id</code> does not conform to
HTTP semantics, because such request would not be sending a <em>complete representation</em> of the invoice <em>for replacement</em>.</p>

<p>With the constraints of the methods GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, the traditional answer
is to define the paid flag of a given invoice to be a resource by itself. So,
you define a route to be able to PUT <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">paid=1</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/invoices/:id/paid</code>. You have
to do that because PUT does not allow <em>partial updates</em> to a resource.</p>

<p>Now let’s think about ordinary edit forms in typical Ruby on Rails applications.
How many times are we sending a complete representation for replacement? Not
always, perhaps we could say that it is even rare in practice that you do so.
For example, the conventional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">created_at</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updated_at</code> timestamps normally
can’t be set by end-users, though they are often considered to belong to the
representation of resources that map to records.</p>

<p>PUT in addition is an <em>idempotent</em> method. You should be able to replay a request
as many times as you want and get the same resource, something that sometimes
is violated by conventional idioms for creating children resources using
nested attributes while updating a parent resource.</p>

<p>There’s nothing theoretical preventing PUT from doing partial updates, but when
HTTP was being standarized the replacement semantics were already deployed.</p>

<p>Because of that, the <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.txt">PATCH</a> method was defined in 1995 and standarized later.
PATCH is a method that is not safe,
nor idempotent, and allows <em>full and partial updates</em> and <em>side-effects on other resources</em>.</p>

<p>In practice, as you see, PATCH suits everyday web programming way better than
PUT for updating resources. In Ruby on Rails it corresponds naturally to the way
we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update_attributes</code> for updating records.</p>

<p>Thus, PATCH is going to be the primary method for updates in Rails 4.0.</p>

<h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>

<p>This is an important change, but we plan to do it in a way that is backwards
compatible.</p>

<p>When a resource is declared in <em>config/routes.rb</em>, for example,</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>resources :users
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>the action in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UsersController</code> to update a user is still <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update</code> in Rails 4.0.</p>

<p>PUT requests to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/users/:id</code> in Rails 4.0 get routed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update</code> as they are
today. So, if you have an API that gets real PUT requests it is going to work.</p>

<p>In Rails 4.0, though, the router also routes PATCH requests to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/users/:id</code> to
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update</code> action.</p>

<p>So, in Rails 4.0 both PUT and PATCH are routed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update</code>.</p>

<h2 id="forms">Forms</h2>

<p>Forms of persisted resources:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>form_for @user
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>get “patch” in the hidden field “_method”. The RFC is deliberately vague about
the way to represent changes in a PATCH request. Submitting a form is
perfectly valid, client and server must simply agree on the accepted ways
to update a resource.</p>

<p>Let me emphasize that the “_method” hack is a workaround for the limitations in
web browsers. As you probably know Rails routes real HTTP methods. That is, actual
PUT, DELETE, and now, PATCH requests are routed to their respective actions.</p>

<h2 id="general-availability">General availability</h2>

<p>PATCH requests are available in all places where the rest of the methods are
available today. There is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">patch</code> macro for the routes DSL, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:via</code> understands
the symbol <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:patch</code>. Tests can issue PATCH requests, request objects respond to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">patch?</code>, etc. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/002713c64568114f3754799acc0723ea0d442f7a">original commit</a> for details (with an important
followup <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/b7a094536de6fdeb428aa79d21f1e2128169f45e">here</a>).</p>

<h2 id="will-my-web-server-understand-patch">Will my web server understand PATCH?</h2>

<p>Yes, it should. I have personally tried Apache, nginx, Phusion Passenger,
Unicorn, Thin, and WEBrick. They all understood PATCH requests out of the box.</p>

<p>Also, HTTP clients should be in general able to issue PATCH requests. For example
in curl(1) you’d execute:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>curl -d'user[name]=wadus' -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/users/1
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>

<p>We would like to thank <a href="https://github.com/dlee">David Lee</a> for this
contribution and endless patience to keep interested in this even <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505">after months
of discussion</a>.</p>

<p>Also I would like to
highlight the quality of the patch itself. It is excellent: code, tests, all
docs revised, comments in code revised. Everything carefully and
thoroughly updated. <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/002713c64568114f3754799acc0723ea0d442f7a">An exemplar patch</a>.</p>
