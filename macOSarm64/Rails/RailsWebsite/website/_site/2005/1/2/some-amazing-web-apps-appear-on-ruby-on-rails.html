Companies around the world are already employing full-time Railers, like &#8221;http://www.combustionlabs.com/&#8220;&gt;Combustion Labs&lt;/a&gt; (4 developers),  &#8221;http://www.robotcoop.com/&#8220;&gt;The Robot Coop&lt;/a&gt; (4 developers), &#8221;http://www.collaboraid.biz/&#8220;&gt;Collaboraid&lt;/a&gt; (3 developers), &#8221;http://www.basesys.com/&#8220;&gt;Base Systems&lt;/a&gt; (2 developers), &#8221;http://www.37signals.com&quot;&gt;37signals&lt;/a&gt; (2 developers), and of course a legion of independent consultants and tech departments in tons of universities and big corporations (read more).But I agree with Luis that big companies won&#8217;t be picking up Ruby on Rails for real before 2006. So that&#8217;ll leave the front runners and early adopters among small companies with a significant competitive advantage for the entirety of 2005. Congratulations, guys." />

<p>Luis made a safe bet predicting that &#8220;amazing web apps&#8221; will come barring the banner of Ruby on Rails: It happened on the 1st day of 2005! <a href="http://www.43things.com">43things.com</a> launched and it is indeed an amazing web application that has the most lofty of goals: Push human ambition higher!</p>
<p>Luckily, Luis is already kinda wrong on &#8220;no full-time jobs appear, will be fully wrong half-way into the New Year, and even <i>silly wrong</i> by the end of December 2005. Companies around the world are already employing full-time Railers, like &#8221;http://www.combustionlabs.com/&#8220;&gt;Combustion Labs&lt;/a&gt; (4 developers),  &#8221;http://www.robotcoop.com/&#8220;&gt;The Robot Coop&lt;/a&gt; (4 developers), &#8221;http://www.collaboraid.biz/&#8220;&gt;Collaboraid&lt;/a&gt; (3 developers), &#8221;http://www.basesys.com/&#8220;&gt;Base Systems&lt;/a&gt; (2 developers), &#8221;http://www.37signals.com&quot;&gt;37signals&lt;/a&gt; (2 developers), and of course a legion of independent consultants and tech departments in tons of universities and big corporations (<a href="http://one.textdrive.com/pipermail/rails/2004-December/000892.html">read more</a>).</p>
