We recently got Slashdotted and a ton of cool applications are coming out using Rails.We&#8217;ve certainly come quite a long way in six months.But its only going to get better. A lot better. Dave Thomas is writing the first book on Rails, the mystical 1.0 release is just 1-2 months away, and there&#8217;s a number of cool speaking engagements coming up at future conferences that&#8217;s going to push awareness even higher.If you&#8217;re reading this, I salute you for being one of the early adopters (or at least interested) that has helped bring Rails this far. Happy half-birthday, Rails!" />
