  <meta name="description" content=" Curt Hibbs has written a great tutorial called Rolling with Ruby on Rails. It takes the reader through setting up Ruby on Rails, scaffolding an application into immediate use, and tailoring the results.

You can&mdash;without making any sacrifices in the quality of your application! How is this possible?I&#8217;m always hesitant to provide any exact measures of productivity increases, but the 10x number has been echoed by more than a few of the Java programmers I&#8217;ve known coming over. Of course, most projects involve lots more than just programming, so this would hardly mean a project completed 10x &mdash; or whatever multiplier you fancy &mdash; but the difference is indeed startling.In any case, awesome work, Curt! Let this serve as an encouragement for other Railers to spread the good work by getting their knowledge published by outfits like O&#8217;Reilly." />
