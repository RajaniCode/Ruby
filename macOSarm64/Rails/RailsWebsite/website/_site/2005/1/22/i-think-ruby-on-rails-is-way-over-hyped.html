<p>I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s too complex, Patrick. Can&#8217;t beat an expert at his own game.

<p>Brian McCallister offers a <a href="http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/src/fear-driven-development.html">similar rejection</a> of Patrick&#8217;s fear mongering:</p>
<blockquote><i>It is scary (<span class="caps">FEAR</span> <span class="caps">FEAR</span>) to see opinions formed, and backed with vitriol, by fear that something different than what they are doing works better.
