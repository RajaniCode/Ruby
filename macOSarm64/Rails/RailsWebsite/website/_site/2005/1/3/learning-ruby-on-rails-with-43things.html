From the start, it was easy to learn, full of wonderous surprises, and it encouraged excellent coding practices such as separation of controllers, models, and views, unit testing, and documentation.It has only been a little over 3 months since I started working in Rails, and 43 Things will be launching soon having been written completely with it. Having used several other languages and frameworks to build websites in the past for both personal and professional sites (I used to work at Amazon), I can say that this has been the most enjoyable one yet." />
