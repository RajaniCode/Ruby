What types of automation does Rails employ to help developers create great apps so quickly?David: The basic philosophy is to encourage good behavior through invitations. So, for example, when you use the generator to create a new model or controller, it also creates unit test stubs that are all hooked up. You just enter a new test case and off you go. The same goes to fixtures, where a YAML file is already created and hooked up, just waiting for you to input the data&#8230;We also talk about Rake and continuos integration with Damage Control.

I just started converting a small J2EE project to Rails, and let me just say that Rails is highly addictive stuff." />
