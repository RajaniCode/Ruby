As far as a web application platform, I can&#8217;t think of a single thing better.This was just one of a few stops Tobias made on his trip down to Orange County. A trip that was as much about personal believing as convincing others:Its great to talk about rails with people face to face and Its even greater to see the adoption rate increase so radical and even make it into new industries daily. Its exciting times and It will only get better. Rails is where its at." />
