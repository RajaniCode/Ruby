We build a complete e-commerce application and go through all the sub-frameworks of Rails. There&#8217;s even a good 30-paged chapter on how to take your application online.

We&#8217;d be double happy if you bought the combo-pack, which also includes the final hardcopy book &#8212; but doesn&#8217;t hand all the cash to distributors and Amazon.The Pragmatic Bookshelf has a lot more Rails books lurking under the surface. The success of this first title will be a good indicator for how many gets the &#8220;go&#8221;. I&#8217;m sure other publishers are watching this thing closely too in order to determine their involvement. So let&#8217;s make this the home run title that grows the market above and beyond." />
