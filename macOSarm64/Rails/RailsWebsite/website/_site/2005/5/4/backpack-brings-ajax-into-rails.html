It&#8217;s joyful to see that the Ajax integration in Rails has caught the interest of so many developers and 37signals is especially thankful for the work of people like Sam Stephenson, Thomas Fuchs, Sean Treadway, and others.Over the coming weeks, we&#8217;ll be taking advantage of even more of the Ajax innovation happening in Rails, such as the upload progress indicator and the Google Suggest-style searching. In the meanwhile, do checkout Backpack as the currently best example of the wonders of Ajax in Rails." />
