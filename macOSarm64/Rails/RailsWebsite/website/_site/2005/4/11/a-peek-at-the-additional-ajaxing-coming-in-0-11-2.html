Web applications are soon going to be hot on the heels of the GUI goodness we&#8217;ve grown accustomed to with OS X.But not content to show of the effects, Thomas has also recorded two impressive movies demoing the upcoming support for both auto-completion form fields and for an upload progress bar (which he has been working on together with Sean Treadway).Thomas has been a driving force behind most of the new effects and the two fantastically cool abstractions of complete approaches.
