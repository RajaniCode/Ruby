And Patrick has been so nice as to walk us through the entire procedure.If any of this has made you hot for Typo, Planet Argon is offering Typo hosting for as low as $3/month. And  Patrick also did a migration script for moving from MT 3.x to Typo.It appears that my excuses for still running Loud Thinking on Movable Type and this blog on WordPress are growing even thinner. Expect a transition in the not-too-distant future." />
