And as I spotted this, I saw that Rails was already trading at twice the value of number two (Flex) and more than four times the value of Java. Wow!Puzzled as to what all this would mean, I asked recognized internet entrepreneur Thomas Madsen-Mygdal. As the founder of internet conference Reboot, co-founder of wifi hotshot Organic, and a slew of other companies, I knew he would know. While Rails was trading at $22, he predicted:I see the core fundamentals in the Rails market taking it to 80 dollars six months. A strong buy recommendation.Holy moly! That&#8217;s a four-fold increase prediction right there. Not one to distrust Thomas, I immediately invested all my starting capital of $10,000. Are you in yet?" />
