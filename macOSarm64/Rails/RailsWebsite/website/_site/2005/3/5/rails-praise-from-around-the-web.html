You have J2EE which is geared towards the most complex projects, and then you have server side scripting which can be used for simpler projects. Rails fits right in the middle, which I believe satisfies the requirements of a majority of the projects out there.Zef Hemel is digging into the scaffolding fun and ease of installation:I love Ruby on Rails. It&rsquo;s very easy to use and seems very productive. I&rsquo;ve often complained about the amount of work that you have to put into applications that basically don&rsquo;t do much more than adding, editting, linking and removing entities. RoR makes this very easy&#8230; What I also liked is how easy it was to get started. On Windows all I needed was to download the Ruby installer and MySQL and I was ready to go. It was very easy to install RoR by using gems and as RoR came with the Webrick webserver, there was no confusing Apache configuration or anything." />
