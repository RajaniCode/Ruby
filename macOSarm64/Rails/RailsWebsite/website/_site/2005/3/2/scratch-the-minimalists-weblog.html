Scratch gives you nothing more than the meta-weblog API for posting. Reading is done via Atom or RSS. That&#8217;s it. There&#8217;s no HTML to hack up. You don&#8217;t have to use the same, tired old web log template that everyone else is using. Break out of that blue, rounded rectangle! Be original! Thumb your nose at those primitive apes still using the web! Use Scratch!
