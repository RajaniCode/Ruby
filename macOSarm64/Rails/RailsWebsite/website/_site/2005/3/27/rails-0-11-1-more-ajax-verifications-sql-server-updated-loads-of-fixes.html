        <p>The Ajax wave is sweeping across Rails. In this release, we&#8217;ve added a :position option to both link_to_remote and form_remote_tag that can be set to either :before, :top, :bottom, or :after.

<p><strong>Yellow Fade Technique</strong><br />

This is the &lt;a href=http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000558.php"&gt;37signals&#8217; Yellow Fade Technique&lt;/a&gt; that&#8217;s now available as Effect.Highlight(id) &#8212; perfect for highlighting a new element that was just added with Ajax.

The <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/Ajax+Discussion">wiki discussion page for Ajax in Rails</a> already has great ideas for slide, fadeout, and squish.</p>
<p><strong>Verifications</strong><br />
<a href="http://rails.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionController/Verification.html">Verifications</a> in a whole new module for Action Pack that allows you to specify preconditions for you actions. They come in the form of &#8220;verify that these parameters are part of the request or redirect the user somewhere else (possibly adding a message to the flash)&#8221;. Or said in code:</p>
<pre>
verify :params =&gt; "post", :only =&gt; [ :create, :update ], :redirect_to =&gt; { :action =&gt; "index" }
</pre>
<p><strong><span class="caps">SQL</span> Server adapter updated</strong><br />
The Micrsoft <span class="caps">SQL</span> Server adapter is back in top form supporting both file uploads (albeit still restricted by <span class="caps">SQL</span> Server&#8217;s 7KB limit) and the new limit style. Thanks to DeLynn Berry for the quick update. Now only the DB2 adapter is not supporting the new limit style.</p>
<p><strong>Loads of fixes</strong><br />
Iconv is no longer required to install Rails (but you&#8217;ll want it if you need to send/receive <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 with Action Mailer), you can clone Active Records with floats, the dispatch.fcgi has been fixed, and a bunch of other things. In total, this release has 30 new features, additions, tweaks, and fixes.</p>
