But luckily, Aredridel made a patch to get the original exception bubbled up a while back. Apply that while you&#8217;re at it.Note: As Ruby-FastCGI has temporarily disappeared from the RAA listing, you might like to know that the direct link is http://www.moonwolf.com/ruby/archive/ruby-fcgi-0.8.5.tar.gz" />
