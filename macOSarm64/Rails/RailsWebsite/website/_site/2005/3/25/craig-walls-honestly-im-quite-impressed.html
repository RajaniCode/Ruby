<p>My emphasis. This is the same conclusion that Bruce Tate has been talking about. It actually <i>does</i> rapidly improve your ability to deliver working software. Is the factor 2, 5, or 10 times? Who knows (and cares?). How about we just settle it at it&#8217;s enough of an improvement that you ought to try it out for size.</p>
