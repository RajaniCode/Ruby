  <meta name="description" content="Asterisk is the open-source PBX that makes the phone an interesting and hackable device again. But the UI is more than a little geeky, which is where RAGI comes in. It&#8217;s the Ruby Asterisk Gateway Interface that serves as a bridge between Ruby on Rails and Asterix. Their pitch goes:RAGI eases the development of interactive automated telephony applications such as IVR, call routing, automated call center, and extended IP-PBX functionality by leveraging the productivity of the Ruby on Rails framework.  RAGI simplifies the process of creating rich telephony and web apps with a single common web application framework, object model and database backend.   RAGI is available under the BSD license.Pretty exciting stuff." />
