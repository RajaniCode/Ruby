There are still things I can do faster with php, but this is a skills gap issue on my part &#8211; there is always a slow period when you first learn something new, and it&rsquo;s easy to just sack it and continue as you are, so it is important to keep making progess during these stages &#8211; this book will ensure that you do. Each new chapter teaches something new, significant and interesting, it is well written gets a 4.5 out of 5 from me. Excellent.Richard Monson-Haefel, an analyst with the Burton Group, writes:In my opinion, this is one of the best development books I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of reading in a long time. I found myself reading almost the entire book &#8211; which is unusual since I normally can&#8217;t get past a few pages in most technical books before labeling it crap and putting in the circular bin.
