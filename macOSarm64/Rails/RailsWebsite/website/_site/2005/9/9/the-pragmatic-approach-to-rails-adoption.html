<p>It&#8217;s definitely a continuum. Rails doesn&#8217;t replace, well, <i>anything</i>. Things are never replaced, but increase and decrease in relevance. Rails has decreased the relevance of a lot of environments, including J2EE, for a growing niche of application types. But it hasn&#8217;t replaced them and never will.</p>
