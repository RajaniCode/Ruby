  <meta name="description" content="Strongspace is a smashing new Rails-powered service from TextDrive. Their pick-up line goes as follows:Strongspace is a secure place to gather, store, back-up and share any type of file with your co-workers, friends and family. You can upload, download and manage your files over SFTP (Secure FTP) or with any modern web browser.It&#8217;s a place in the sky without all the overhead of maintaining a real hosting environment for it. Just targeted space at great prices. They start at $8/month for 4 gigabytes of space. It&#8217;s a perfect fit for Basecamp space too. They even have a movie showing how easy it is to setup your Basecamp account to use Strongspace.The application itself is also wonderfully designed and delivered by the Rails&#8217; team at TextDrive consisting of Michael Koziarski, Marten Veldthuis, Johan S&ouml;rensen, and Justin French. Congratulations on the launch, guys." />
