It&#8217;s going down in the lovely Chicago Summer on June 22nd through 25th. There are a lot of details yet to be determined, but Dave Thomas and myself are already lined up to keynote.Further details will soon trickle in. Such as how to propose a talk and naturally how to sign up for the event. We&#8217;re most likely going to cap the attendance to a hard 400. So if you don&#8217;t want to miss RailsConf like a lot of people missed RubyConf (which was capped at 200), you&#8217;d probably do be well-advised to stay alert on the opening of registrations.Expect the registration fee to be around $350-400. So if you need to start saving, do that." />
