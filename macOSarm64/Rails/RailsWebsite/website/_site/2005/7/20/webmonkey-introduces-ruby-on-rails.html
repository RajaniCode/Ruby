That eliminates much of the preliminary busywork necessary to create such a site, but also enforces a tight, sane structure on the code, which has the effect of making development very facile. It&#8217;s like working in a well-organized company: it takes a little time to figure out who sits where and what they do, but once you understand the structure, you can use it to your advantage without having to make lots of micro-managerial decisions all the time." />
