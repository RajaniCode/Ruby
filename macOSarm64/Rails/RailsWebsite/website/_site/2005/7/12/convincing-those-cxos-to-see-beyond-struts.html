Is this a good decision on their part? I don&#8217;t think so. I think it&#8217;s more important to hire smart people that can learn a technology, rather than hiring those that know a technology. Of course, if someone knows a technology really well, there&#8217;s probably no harm in hiring them.Considering the nice flow of job applications we&#8217;ve been posting on this weblog and the growing number that has been appearing at places like craigslist, I&#8217;m pretty sure this is a mirage. I haven&#8217;t heard of anyone getting into Rails development that hasn&#8217;t been able to hire.And the step from corporations like Bank of America posting job listings with Rails as a &#8220;nice to have&#8221; to &#8220;required&#8221; is not that big.

<p>So it&#8217;s not about scaling. Rather, Matt sees the problem as an appearance of being unable to hire:</p>

<p>Considering the nice flow of job applications we&#8217;ve been posting on this weblog and the growing number that has been appearing at places like craigslist, I&#8217;m pretty sure this is a mirage.

<p>And the step from corporations like <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/06/30/ruby-on-rails-making-inroads-in-corporate-america/">Bank of America posting job listings with Rails</a> as a &#8220;nice to have&#8221; to &#8220;required&#8221; is not that big. And with <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/07/12/epson-chooses-rails-for-developer-site/">wins at places like <span class="caps">EPSON</span></a>, it gets even easier.</p>
