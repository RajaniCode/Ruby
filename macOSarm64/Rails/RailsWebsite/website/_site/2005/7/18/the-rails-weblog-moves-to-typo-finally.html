But with the appearance of Typo and it&#8217;s massive uptake and rapid improvement, we have a very viable solution now. So goodbye, WordPress! You served us in a crunch, but I&#8217;m also very pleased to see you go.The switch means that we&#8217;ll actually be able to keep comments open without the blogging engine mysteriously shutting them off.
