We&#8217;ve fixed a ton of major, minor, and aesthetic issues and now have a package that we would be very proud to call 1.0. No, it&#8217;s not completely spotless. A project of this size with thousands of programmers using it for every application type under the moon will never be. But it&#8217;s Pretty Damn Good.So here it goes: Release candidate 5. This is the final, short pitstop before 1.0 materializes next week. Thus, you&#8217;re more than well advised to upgrade and make sure we didn&#8217;t leave anything heinous in there. This is the &#8220;speak now or forever hold your peace&#8221; part of the ceremony.If you already upgraded to 0.14.x, going to RC5 is completely effortless. Simply call upon the gems to do your bidding with: gem install rails --include-dependencies. And you&#8217;ll be serving up your application with all the bugs squashed. On top of that, we&#8217;ve thrown in a new adapter for the Firebird database and added a beautiful new index.html that&#8217;ll greet you on new applications:So upgrade, dammit! Now. And stand by as we finish setting up the fireworks planned for next week&#8217;s release of the long-awaited 1.0. It&#8217;s magical times, my friends, and the spellcasting is just getting started.The interesting changes are in:Rails 0.14.4Action Pack 1.11.1Active Record 1.13.1" />
