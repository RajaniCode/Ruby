  <meta name="description" content="Obie Fernandez has a great story on how ThoughtWorks recently won a $800,000 bid for a critical application against another consultancy. They probably do that all the time, but the interesting part about this particular bid is that they made it powered by Ruby on Rails. The other consultancy bid a million dollars for a Java-based system, but the CIO picked the Rails solution from ThoughtWorks.So saving $200,000 was obviously a big advantage of the Rails bid, but more interesting is the second-level concerns.

As he put it:Developers have more fun, make more money, and customers get better products cheaper and faster.Indeed.UPDATE: The story is indeed &#8220;fictional&#8221;, but with the very deep underlining of &#8220;inspired by real events&#8221;.

        <p>Obie Fernandez has a great story on <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/obie?entry=productivity_arbitrage">how ThoughtWorks recently won a $800,000 bid</a> for a critical application against another consultancy. They probably do that all the time, but the interesting part about this particular bid is that they made it powered by Ruby on Rails. The other consultancy bid a million dollars for a Java-based system, but the <span class="caps">CIO</span> picked the Rails solution from ThoughtWorks.</p>
<p>So saving $200,000 was obviously a big advantage of the Rails bid, but more interesting is the second-level concerns. Obie writes:</p>

<p>Indeed.</p>
<p><b><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:</b> The story is indeed &#8220;fictional&#8221;, but with the very deep underlining of &#8220;inspired by real events&#8221;.
