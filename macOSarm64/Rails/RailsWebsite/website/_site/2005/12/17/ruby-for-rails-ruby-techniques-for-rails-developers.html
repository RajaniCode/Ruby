I&#8217;m very pleased to see that Manning went ahead with his &#8220;Ruby for Rails&#8221; proposal and now advertises the book for release in April.This is an important book for the growth of Ruby on Rails as a platform. Lots of people are learning Rails first and then diving into Ruby as they need to. This book will target exactly that kind of people. Someone who&#8217;s getting into Ruby because of Rails and then wants to know more about the language as they progress.Manning puts the pitch like this:A new level of programming power and versatility awaits Ruby on Rails developers who master not only the conventions of Rails but the workings of the Ruby language itself. Because Rails itself and all Rails applications are written in Ruby, the knowledge of Ruby this book gives you will dramatically improve your Rails programming. You&#8217;ll gain an intimate understanding of how familiar Rails idioms actually work. And you&#8217;ll find expanded possibilities for your applications using custom-written Ruby.The other great thing about this book is that it&#8217;ll most likely be available as a PDF. Like the Pragmatic Bookshelf, Manning has long been pushing ebooks, which means its one of the only publishers I&#8217;ll actually pick up titles from on a regular basis. Hopefully &#8220;Ruby for Rails&#8221; marks just the beginning of a broader selection that goes beyond the almost Java-exclusive focus they&#8217;ve had in the past.So if this sounds intriguing, please do sign up to be alerted of the books release. I&#8217;m sure Manning is using interest like that to determine how to proceed with further projects in the Ruby world." />

Black is a pillar in the Ruby community, a co-founder of RubyCentral, toastmaster at RubyConf, and an all-round awesome Ruby programmer and friend. I&#8217;m very pleased to see that Manning went ahead with his &#8220;Ruby for Rails&#8221; proposal and now <a href="http://www.manning.com/books/black">advertises the book</a> for release in April.</p>
<p>This is an important book for the growth of Ruby on Rails as a platform. Lots of people are learning Rails first and then diving into Ruby as they need to. This book will target exactly that kind of people. Someone who&#8217;s getting into Ruby because of Rails and then wants to know more about the language as they progress.</p>
<p>Manning puts the pitch like this:</p>
<blockquote><i>A new level of programming power and versatility awaits Ruby on Rails developers who master not only the conventions of Rails but the workings of the Ruby language itself. Because Rails itself and all Rails applications are written in Ruby, the knowledge of Ruby this book gives you will dramatically improve your Rails programming. You&#8217;ll gain an intimate understanding of how familiar Rails idioms actually work. And you&#8217;ll find expanded possibilities for your applications using custom-written Ruby.</i></blockquote>
<p>The other great thing about this book is that it&#8217;ll most likely be available as a <span class="caps">PDF</span>.
