  <meta name="description" content="While we&#8217;ve had restricted parts of the Rails repository available for committing by others than yours truly (Leon on AWS, Sam on prototype), the trunk has been closely guarded until this point. But it&#8217;s time to share the load, if only a little. So I hereby announce that Jamis Buck (minam) and Jeremy Kemper (bitsweat) has been bestowed with commit rights.Jamis is already the main driver of Action Mailer, my follow programmer at 37signals, and the creator of lots of Ruby open source software. He was also one of the very first people to ever submit a patch to Rails as he did the first implementation of has_and_belongs_to_many. He is indeed one of the best programmers I know.Jeremy has proved his invaluable worth for Rails time and again. Next to myself, he has by far the most patches accepted in the trunk. Which often has included extensive improvements to the health of the framework in form of refactorings and expanded test coverage. Jeremy has also just accepted a full-time position with CD Baby, so he&#8217;ll continue to be working all Rails, all the time.Much congratulations to both of them. It&#8217;s a little tough relinquishing the keys to treasury, but it&#8217;s time, and I don&#8217;t think I could have picked a better pair to inaugurate the expansion of the commit group." />
