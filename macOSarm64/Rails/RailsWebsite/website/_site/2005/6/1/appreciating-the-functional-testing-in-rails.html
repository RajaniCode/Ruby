And it&#8217;s done in a dead-simple way. No Cactus, no mock container, no extra framework to install. It&#8217;s all built right in.

We&#8217;ve tried really hard to make testing so easy that it feels like fun, not a chore. Now that you&#8217;ve checked out functional tests, do dig deeper into the great mock support in Rails." />

<p>Thanks, Jonathan. We&#8217;ve tried really hard to make testing so easy that it feels like fun, not a chore. Now that you&#8217;ve checked out functional tests, do dig deeper into the <a href="http://scott.elitists.net/users/scott/posts/mockery">great mock support in Rails</a>.</p>
