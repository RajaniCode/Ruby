And it&#8217;s going to be a Rails application, of course. Like all the other management software they&#8217;re building over there. The first we&#8217;ll see of TextPanel will be a reduced version, which will power the forthcoming Strongspace offering.Cheers to Justin, Marten, Jason, Dean, and all the others at TextDrive for pushing the hosting envelope on so many fronts. And what a steal in picking up a relationship with Michael Koziarski. He has been the untiring force behind verifying, prioritizing, and managing the ticket cue on Rails for a good long while. Congratulations to both parties." />
