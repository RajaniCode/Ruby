I have been FAR more productive with RoR after just a few months of learning Ruby and a few weeks of using RoR than I am with .NET even though I&#8217;ve been coding on the MS platform for 10 years, with half of that time spent almost exclusively working on web applications.Romney especially likes Active Record and the &#8220;architectural guidance&#8221; of the framework.
