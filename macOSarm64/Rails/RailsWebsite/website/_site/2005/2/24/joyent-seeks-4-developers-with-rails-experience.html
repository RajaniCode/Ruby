Some experience with Mozilla&#8217;s XUL is a big plus (it&#8217;s a bigger plus if they understand why XUL isn&#8217;t a complete solution). We will provide relocation (and visa, etc. sponsorship) assistance, but relocation is not necessary for the first phase. If desired, relocation would happen in the September, 2005 timeframe.If you&#8217;re interested, get in touch with david at joyent dot com." />
