They&#8217;re contributing big time to the development of Rails and are up to date with the latest (like exploring lighttpd as an Apache alternative). They&#8217;ve won the heart of many big-time Railers, like the Pragmatic Programmers, Scott Barron, Marten Veldthuis, and many others.Now they&#8217;re offering you a limited opportunity of a life-time account for just $399. The drive is called VC II and is a very interesting way to allow users to expand the company&#8217;s ambitions by getting something in return and keeping foreign capitals (and the onslaught of strings attached) out.Better be quick, though. The last drive they did sold out in no time fast." />
