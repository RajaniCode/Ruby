  <meta name="description" content="Jamis Buck did a presentation of Rails for the Utah Java Users Group two nights ago. He has made the entire show available online including the Terminal videos used to show the programming. The presentation was given in between one about JDO and Howard Lewis Ship&#8217;s one about Tapestry. Here&#8217;s what one of the spectators noted:As a witness to the event, I have to say that the presentation went quite well. This is what I learned from each speaker:1) JDO is losing popularity to Hibernate, 2) How to build a entire CRUD app in 40 min using Rails, 3) How to build a single login screen in 1 hour using Tapestry. Hmmmm&#8230; kinda indicative of the tools presented. :)Congratulations on the good show, Jamis!" />
