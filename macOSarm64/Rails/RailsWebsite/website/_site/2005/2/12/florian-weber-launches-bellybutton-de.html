The shop is part a CMS for the company behind it to manage the content on the site and part a e-commerce operation to take and process orders. And it&#8217;s very nicely designed too!In addition to the launch, Florian has written a short retrospect of the project. He talks about not optimizing too soon, using a strong domain model, and having Damage Control do continuos integration.The completion of bellybutton should also herald Florian&#8217;s return to active Rails development. Florian had a lot of interesting developments going in Rails before bellybutton kidnapped him for three months. We&#8217;re eagerly awaiting his return." />
