That hook got the interest of The New York Times, but to get the full story, you&#8217;ll be well advised to read Evan&#8217;s blog posting about it and the Odeo blog in general.I had a sneak peak at the application a few days ago and it looks mighty cool. I&#8217;m a big fan of podcasting myself (especially from the ever excellent ITConversations), so the prospect of Odeo makes me pretty excited.What also makes me excited is Odeo running Ruby on Rails. Remember that posting Evhead advertises for a Rails developer back in the beginning of December? That resulted in the hiring of Rabble as the lead developer on Odeo. He talks about the Odeo launch and how they &#8220;&#8230;built it with the wonderful Ruby on Rails framework&#8221; in his blog.So congratulations, guys! It&#8217;s great to see another high-profile site launch on Rails and loving it. Keep &#8217;em coming." />
