        <p>Hi there! This is <a href="https://twitter.com/_cha1tanya">Prathamesh</a>, bringing you the latest edition of This Week in Rails, covering highlights from the Rails community, as well as changes recently made to the framework. Let‚Äôs dive in!</p>

<h3 id="this-weeks-contributors"><a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20180122-20180126">This Week‚Äôs Contributors</a></h3>

<p>This week there were 22 contributors to Rails including contributions from 4 first-timers. Thanks!</p>

<h3 id="multi-statement-query-for-inserting-fixtures"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/31422">Multi-statement query for inserting fixtures</a></h3>

<p>This change constructs a single query for inserting fixtures from different tables. This change reduced the time to load around 700 fixtures from 15 seconds to 8 seconds! üèé</p>

<h3 id="custom-handling-of-exceptions-that-are-discarded"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/30622">Custom handling of exceptions that are discarded</a></h3>

<p>This change allows a job that is discarded to be handled by a custom handler. The <strong><em>retry_on</em></strong> already provides the ability for a custom handler and now same has been added to <strong><em>discard_on</em></strong> handler.</p>

<h3 id="support-for-postgresql-foreign-tables"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/31549">Support for PostgreSQL foreign tables</a></h3>

<p>With this change, it will be possible to work with models backed by foreign tables present in external PostgreSQL servers.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs it for this week. Many more changes were introduced to Rails than were featured here, check out the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/master@%7B2018-01-22%7D...@%7B2018-01-26%7D">full week of commit activity</a> to learn more!</p>
