This is a release mostly for people who&#8217;ve already been following along with the development of Rails 3.1 and want to try a version that&#8217;s close to feature complete.We do not yet have all the documentation ready, so it&#8217;s still a bit of a detective job to figure out how it all fits together. Thus, this is not a general release and I wont hold it against you if you&#8217;re holding out for a release candidate (coming in the next few weeks).The tag is 3.1.0.beta1 and you can install using gem install rails --pre. Enjoy!" />
